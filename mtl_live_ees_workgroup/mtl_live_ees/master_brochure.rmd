# *Modeling to Learn*: Experiments and Decisions, Session X (4 through 12)

## **Objectives:** 
1. Describe relationships between team decisions and the teamâ€™s delivery of evidence-based psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies (EBPs).
2. Develop hypotheses about team decisions that could improve EBP reach.
3. Describe likely impacts of team decisions like overbooking and target return visit intervals on metrics such as no-show rates, new patient start rates, and patients completing a recommended course of treatment.
4. Decide team practices to improve EBP reach with existing resources.

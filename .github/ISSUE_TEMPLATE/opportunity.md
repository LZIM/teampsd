**Executive Summary**

*Lead team for effort:*

*Key people (use @ assignment for people whose input will be necessary):*



**Step 1 - Complete the Interdependencies Table**

Workgroup Leads review information provided by originator and collaborate to identify interdependencies. Then they describe modifications that are needed in the appropriate column and estimate hours needed to make changes:
 
● *Workgroup Products* - This column identifies the workgroups and the products for which they are responsible. This column can be
  modified by a workgroup lead on an ad-hoc basis to add one-time products or can be modified to include new and enduring products.
  
● *Dependency?* - This column is used by the workgroup leads during collaboration to identify the existence of an interdependency.

● *Description of Change or Action Needed* - Workgroup leads briefly describe the change required.

● *Hours* - Workgroup leads estimate the person-hours required to complete the task.

**Step 2 - Identify Constraints that may affect the team’s ability to complete the necessary actions.** 

Describe the constraint in terms of capability, capacity or affect on grant research goals. If there are no constraints identified, then leave the table blank.

●  Type - The type of constraint identifies one or more resource areas that are affected.  

●  Workgroup - this is the workgroup responsible for developing a new or modifying an existing product.

●  Discussion/recommendation - A brief narrative that expands the information regardingthe constraint and ideally a recommendation for
   overcoming the constraint.

**Type Constraint (check all that apply) / Workgroup(s) Affected / Discussion/Recommendation**

- [ ] Capacity      
- [ ] Cost         
- [ ] Schedule     
- [ ] Interference 
- [ ] Capability   
- [ ] Other (describe)

**Step 3 - Identify supported milestones.** *Affix the milestone at the issue level using available GitHub milestones.*

**Step 4 - Indicate the due date for completing the actions identified above, assuming constraints are removed.**


**Step 5 - Identify the lead workgroup for the action (check one):**

- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Investigators
- [ ] Quantitative
- [ ] Qualitative
- [ ] Model
- [ ] Sim UI

### Participatory System Dynamics Resources in R Markdown 

This is an R Markdown presentation for the "Ratio Exercise" learning loop exercise from the participatory learning session of the Team PSD Facilitation Guide. 

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 

We use R and R Markdown so that our materials are open source/free, transparent for collaboration, reproducible by others and can be used repeatedly over time for local sustainability or for adaptation to another local health care system.

### Context

This exercise is introduced after Graphs Over Team has introduced system behaviors and after stakeholders have began to develop some consensus regarding their dynamic hypotheses.

### Purpose

* Elicit feedback loops (especially minor loops), variables within a causal chain, and initiate the more formal model that will be further developed in later learning sessions.

* Increase stakeholders' capacity for 'feedback thinking'

### Primary Nature of the Group Task

Convergent

### Time

Preparation time by facilitators: 30 minutes

Stakeholder time required during session: 10 minutes, plus 30 minutes of debriefing

### Matierals Needed

1. Large erasable white surface (cling sheet or white board)
2. White board markers
3. Recorder will want to capture image in Vensim sketch or with a camera (or both)
4. Modeler or "reflector" may redraw some of the mapped feedback loops

### Inputs

This script can be used when the learners have defined paris of stock variables whose ratio (or difference) makes sense to the team (e.g., patient panel size, staff turnover rate, etc.)

### Ouputs

* Feedback loops are identfied
* Mapping of feedback effects

### Roles

- Facilitator with modest experience in participatory system dynamics; should be able to lead the group in mapping feedback effects (identify the stock variables from the prior learning sessions to set up the "Ratio Exercise" in this session).
- Skilled modelers are needed in the "modeler feedback" follow up where the feedback loops elicited by the group are integrate into more complicated "cleaned up" feedback diagrams.
- Recorder who can capture hand drawn feedback loops or those drawn in Vensim

### Steps to the Ratio Exercise

#### STEP ONE 
####  The facilitator picks out a pair of stocks to work with first.  

* Below are examples from the first session of local observational data that could represent these stocks.

###### Slide with Local Data 

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

###### Plot of the Reference Mode for Local System from Local Data

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

###### Alternative plot of the Reference Mode for Local System from an Image

#### STEP TWO 
##### The facilitator asks the learners to name the ratio or difference (e.g., patient panel size; staff turnover rate).  The facilitator addes the ratio or difference variable using the language provided by the team.  

* Different teams use different reminology for similar concepts. 
* Some teams use differences and some use ratiors (e.g., "no show rate" vs. "# of intakes")

#### STEP THREE 
##### The facilitator maps the ratio (or difference variable) with the incoming arros marked with "+" or "-" as is causally appropriate.

#### STEP FOUR
##### The facilitator asks the question, "What would happen if this ratio were to go to zero or gen unusually small" or "what would happen if this ratior where to become very large- how would the system react?"

* The stakeholders then start to tell feedback stories about how the system reacts when this key ratio (or difference) gets out of whack.  When loops are completed, the facilitator traces them out for the group adding appropriate "+" or "-," telling the stories of the loops.  *These loops are almost always balancing loops.*

#### STEP FIVE
##### Steps 2 through 4 are repeated with another set of ratios.

### Evaluation criteria:

* This script will usually fill a white board with lots of feedback loops very quickly.
* Participants will "get the hang" of what feedback loops are, how they work, and will start to look for them.
* A very good map will have feedback paths that connect to other important stocks in the system (other than simple first order loops).

### Notes
This script will further develop 'off-line.' Working iteratively with VHA mental health stakeholders, Team PSD has worked to identify a clear set of stocks and flows, and patient flow 'aging chains' that undergird the dynamics of the outpatient mental health system.  

* Given there is already a 'seed' stock and flow diagram that can be worked with in future sessions, the goal is to help the stakeholders to see how service loads (i.e., Veterans' needs or patient 'demand' for services) can be linked to mental health resource stocks (e.g., providers, scheduling hours, etc.) so that the pairings make sense.

### Participatory System Dynamics Resources in R Markdown 

This is an R Markdown presentation for the "Initiating and Elaborating a Causal Loop Diagram" learning loop exercise from the participatory learning session of the Team PSD Facilitation Guide. 

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 

We use R and R Markdown so that our materials are open source/free, transparent for collaboration, reproducible by others and can be used repeatedly over time for local sustainability or for adaptation to another local health care system.

### Context

This learning loop exercise is used at the beginning of the project in order to get an initial idea of central concepts and their relationships.  The aim of the participatory system dynamics modeling process is to construct a formal simulation model, therefore it is recommended to build a stock and flow model. 

* When accumulations are important in the issue (e.g., patients flowing through a variety of states in the outpatient mental health system), a stock and flow model is recommended.

### Purpose

* Initiating mapping

* Eliciting relations

* Eliciting feedback loops

### Primary Nature of the Group Task

Convergent

### Time

Preparation time by facilitators: 20 minutes

Stakeholder time required during session: 20 minutes, plus 20 minutes of debriefing

### Matierals Needed

* Three flip charts or wall space on which several flip charts are taped. *OR*
* Whiteboard, markers and flip chart. *AND/OR*
* A project and laptop with Vensim. For this last option, a second person will be necessary to draw the diagram that is elicited in Vensim.

### Inputs

A list of variables

### Ouputs

Deliverable:  A causal loop diagram which may be used as a *dynamic hypothesis* on the basis of which formal modeling will build iteratively.  

* There is also an interim output, which is increased consensus regarding the *dynamic hypothesis* or a possible structural explanation for the observed system behavior (e.g., "limited reach of evidence-based practices")

### Roles

- Facilitator/modeler with experience in drawing causl loop diagrams, preferably with experience in building formal models as well
- Stakeholders

### Steps to Eliciting a Causal Loop Diagram

#### STEP ONE 
####  The facilitator reminds the learners about the problem variable, preferably sketched as a reference mode of behavior.  Reminder the group of the list of variables elicited before.  Place the list of variables in such a way that it is visible to the group of participants.  Write the problem variable in the centre of the white board or black board.

* Below are examples from the first session of local observational data.

###### Slide with Local Data 

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

###### Plot of the Reference Mode for Local System from Local Data

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

###### Alternative plot of the Reference Mode for Local System from an Image

#### STEP TWO 
##### Build the model by following the three following activities:

1. Ask participants which variable from the collected list is a caus for changes in the problem variable.  When someone makes a suggestion, include this in the drawing of the model in order to visualize what is meant.  Then check to see if everyon eagrees with the proposed relation.  If someone disagrees, ask for clarification and try to determine what the group thinks the relationship should be.  If a discussion goes on too long, you can choose to temporarily 'park' this item and continue with another part of the model.  Hopefully, there will not only be variables that have a direct relationship with the problem variable.  but you will also build a few logical chains of reasoning (via intermediate variables) into the model  In addition, check the polarity (positive or negative) of the relationship.

2. After spending some time doing this, proceed to the consequences of changes in the problem variable.

3. At the point where a feedback chain becomes closed, check with the entire group to see if the chain as a whole is correct. Check again to see if a loopo is positive or negative.  *The **Ratio Exercise** may be used to draw out loops.*

#### STEP THREE 
##### IN the last part of the session, analyze the model by checking the feedback loops one more time.  Before you clsoe the group session, make sure you do the following.  If there is a list of parked issues, go through them.  State once more what has been done and what will happen with the products of the learning loop exercise in this this lesson and help the stakeholders to see how this fits within the larger participatory system dynamis modeling process.

### Evaluation criteria:

* Improvement in the quality of communication among stakeholders and within teams.
* New insights and use of systems thinking
* Consensus on the problem 
* Increasing commitment to the participatory system dynamics modeling effort

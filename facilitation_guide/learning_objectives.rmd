Session 2. Team Data  
1.	Describe the individual and aggregated patient data made accessible to the team through the MTL data tool.
2.	Reflect on the implications for quality care or quality work-life of an observed trend in team data. 
3.	Use the MTL data tool to identify individual patients who make up observed team-level trends.  

Session 3. Team Need and Plan 
1.	Identify a trend in service delivery or outcomes (e.g., new patient wait times; provider overwork; etc.) that the team would like to improve.
2.	Describe why this trend is important within the context of the team’s vision for quality care for veterans and quality work-life for team members.
3.	Outline the team’s plan to focus on the identified need using MTL.

Session 4. Care Coordination I  
1.	Describe the factors controlling the relationship between the number of patients in care and the backlog of appointments on the team's schedule.
2.	*Describe the feedback loop that governs the relationship between existing and new patients.*  
3.	Describe two team decisions that affect the availablity of care coordination appointments for new patients.  
4.	Name two team-influenced factors that affect the care coordination missed appointment rate.  
6.	Describe an unintended consequence of overbooking care coordination appointments.

Session 5. Care Coordination II  
1.	Describe trade-offs between allocating appointments for new versus existing patients in terms quality versus access, and for whom.  
2.	Distinguish between external and team-based drivers affecting new patient referrals and understand how these are connected to wait times and the ability to start patients in care coordination.  
3.	Name two decisions within a team’s control to optimize its delivery of care coordination services to veterans.  
4.	*Experiment with changing the average return visit interval and number of new patient carve-outs to develop rules-of-thumb around how these clinical and operational changes affect new patient wait times.*   
5.	Evaluate SMART clinic management changes that would enable the team to meet historic new patient demand, given the current supply of providers.  

Session 6. Med Management I  
1.	Describe team decisions that affect the number of appointments available for existing medication management patients by diagnostic cohort. 
2.	Describe how return visit intervals can be used by the team to adjust the balance between new and existing medication management patients across diagnostic cohorts.  
3.	*Explore how differences in desired average return visit intervals, missed appointment rates, and overbooked appointments across four main diagnostic cohorts affect the team’s ability to provide evidence-based medication management services.*  
4.  Apply lessons learned from Care Coordination sessions to optimizing delivery of Med Management across the four main diagnostic cohorts.
5. Develop new inferences based on the successes and failures of "rules-of-thumb" developed for managing Care Coordination in the more complicated context of Med Management.

Session 7. Med Management II  
1.	Describe decisions teams can make to optimize their delivery of evidence-based Medication Management services.  
2.	*Evaluate trade-offs in timeliness and quality when setting specific return visit intervals for patients based on diagnosis.*   
3.	Explain how teams could effectively manage new patient demand for each diagnostic cohort, given current staffing and training.  

Session 8. Psychotherapy I  
1. Estimate time spent per week on patients who will not receive a complete, timely dose of psychotherapy.
2. Describe how patients who remain in psychotherapy beyond three months impact a team’s overall reach of evidence-based psychotherapy. 
3.	Experiment with patient care “step-up/down” decisions at key points in the patient pathway to see effects on the team’s ability to provide all patients with a complete, timely dose of psychotherapy.  
4.	Distinguish between external and team-based drivers of patient scheduling and how they impact care quality and the ability to start new patients.  

Session 9. Psychotherapy II  
1.	Analyze the effect of "graduating" patients who have completed a full dose of psychotherapy on new patient starts.  
2.	Evaluate SMART changes to care “step-up/down” thresholds that would enable the team to increase their overall reach of evidence-based psychotherapy with their current capacity across the four main diagnostic cohorts (AUD, depression, OUD, and PTSD).  
3.	Develop heuristics around the relative impact of changes in supply versus care “step-up/down” decisions on the ability of the team to provide patients with a complete, timely dose of psychotherapy.  
4.	Evaluate trade-offs between new patient access and quality for existing patients when setting specific “step-up/down” thresholds.  

Session 10. Aggregate Model I  
1.	Describe how the allocation of supply among all services provided by the team (Intake, Care Coord, Med Mgmt, Psych, Group, Adjunct) contributes to overall team performance.  
2.	Describe the multiple effects overtime has on available appointment supply over the short and long term, and evaluate the relative impact of these effects on performance.  
3.	Analyze differences between the appropriate patient start and referral rates given current supply and service characteristics versus the team’s actual start and referral rates.  
4.	Understand how differences across individual service characteristics (e.g., target return visit interval, patients per appointment, appointment length, patient engagement time, etc.) influence the relative impact of changes to clinical decision thresholds or operations in any service on overall team performance.   
5.	Analyze the short and long-term effects of the team’s real-world reactions to a growing appointment backlog (e.g., changing the target return visit interval for service(s) versus working overtime for service(s) versus shifting supply to service(s)) on their ability to start new patients.  

Session 11. Aggregate Model II  
1.	Distinguish between external and team-based drivers of new patient referral rates and understand how these are connected to care quality and the ability to start new patients across all services.  
2.	Evaluate SMART changes to clinical decision thresholds, operations, and supply allocation that would enable the team to increase their overall performance with their current capacity.  
3.	Evaluate the impact clinical and operational changes have on coverage and ability to start new patients across five main diagnostic cohorts (AUD, depression, OUD, PTSD, and other needs).   
4.	Develop heuristics around the relative impact of changes in supply allocation versus operations versus clinical threshold decisions on the ability of the team to provide patients with a evidence-based treatment in psychotherapy and medication management.  
5.	Evaluate trade-offs between access for new patients and care quality for existing patients when designing specific interventions to apply in the team’s clinics after the training is complete.  

Session 12. Our Decisions  
1.	Describe how team decision-making has evolved over the course of Modeling to Learn.  
2.	Describe how team decisions explored throughout the Modeling to Learn series have led to improved team function.   
3.	Explain how multiple feedback relationships determine the team’s performance over both the short- and long-term.  
4.	Explain how the use of team-level data in systems models have led to improved team decision-making.  
5.	Explain how the use of team-level data in systems models have led to improved quality of care.

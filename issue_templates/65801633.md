**Notes and Action Items**

Priority is to stay close to developing PSD resources that are valued by
end-users (frontline staff, clinic managers and Veteran patients)

David will primarily be focusing on the NIH project; however will also
be partnering with VERC (Veterans Engineering Resource Center) who will
be providing VA/CDW data support

Tom and VERC will be helping to faciliate opportunities for VA staff to
review VA data inputs for PSD models, and will provide
expertise synthesizing VA data in Vensim models

Welcome Liz and Andrew, who bring a lot of relevant expertise using data
to improve VA operations

Team PSD is using the Office of Mental Health Operations CDW resources
and performance measure definitions; the our PSD models are intended to
be complementary, more actionable resources to guide clinic
decision-making

Forio is a company with expertise in making models accessible; they can
work with our Vensim model to build their interface

GHPC and Jane have considerable experience building system dynamics
modeling workshops for even highly-partisan stakeholder groups; GHPC has
worked with Forio before and has also worked with large Federal
partners, such as the CDC

Steve talks about the struggle to transparently use data to improve
mental health care; the project has been a huge step forward in a
process generated by providers - hope is that staff will be able
to routinely have ongoing discussions for quality improvement

Ann really emphasized the need for user-friendly tools!

Model Review with David:

1.  Teams provide services and a clinic is comprised of multiple teams
2.  There are multiple types of services e.g., psychotherapy (Individual
    or Group; 60 or 90 minute), pharmacotherapy, care coordination -
    only some of these services would be considered evidence-based
3.  The "Team X" model has conventions such as red font denoting data
    exogenously entered in the model because 1) we know we have that
    data, and 2) stakeholders want to make a decision or experiment with
    that variable
4.  The primary unit of time in the model is quarters

Model represents the problem of limited reach of EBPs:  Patients aren't
getting EBPs because they're getting something else/providers are
spending their time doing something else

We try to use language and structures that reflect the variety of
philosophies among stakeholders about what is important (access and
delays, versus continuity of care and retention in psychotherapy vs.
EBPs etc.)

Jane - Question for frontline staff is limiting the decisions and
controls for the workshop and UI (Lindsey note: also can review the
Forio 

Lindsey - Question about the parameters for each clinic; Working
hypothesis tailored data matters to staff - But, does it (and at what
level)?  (Tom: talked about the balance between the
stakeholders' desires and accuracy of the model)

### 2.0 Discussion

Goal to begin to clarify the participatory process that we would like to
put in place, so that we develop PSD resources that can scale and be
sustained *because they add value to patients, providers and managers in
the clinic *

Begin to plan for ways to organize and iteratively test key
hypotheses with stakeholders across the group model building workshop
resources, user interface and data integration in Vensim DSS models

 

### 3.0 Next Steps

Identify the next steps for each partner relevant for the whole group

Orient everyone to Basecamp for project management

**Discussed:** all action items; created in this meeting

Chat Transcript
---------------

-   hello\
    *Lindsey Zimmerman*
-   \***What would be a good idea to ask/check with/test with front-line
    staff/end users before we go down a path?**\
    *Jane Branscomb*
-   How will the partners work together most effectively?\
    *Tom Rust*
-   I think I'm hearing that "scaling" means creating a tool (model) and
    a process (data input & meeting design) that can be replicated
    usefully in multiple sites. So part of what you're balancing is how
    customized (e.g. maybe different sets of levers) and calibrated
    (local data) the model needs to be.\
    *Jane Branscomb*

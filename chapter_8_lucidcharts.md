# LucidCharts

We're growing and everyone will need to show others how to use LucidCharts.

## Process 

1. Passwords: Team PSD Folder within VA
2. Folders
3. Files

Templates: For Flow Maps, etc. 

I want to start from a template:
File -> New -> From Template

I want to create a new template for the team:
File -> Convert to Template

4. VA Operating System

Font: Set up w/Myriad Pro everywhere, anyway, so that if a users' system has Myriad Pro, it will pick it up.
You can select all using CTRL + A (Windows) or CMD + A (Mac).

Font size: 11 (figures, Myriad) or 12 (peer reviewed manuscript, Arial or Times New Roman)

5. Team PSD style

Myriad Pro, 11-point font
- Bold user name
- Non-bold user role below in parantheses

Check your spelling, punctuation.
Check for clear, concise language.
Remove any abbreviations that might be misunderstood.

Co-Editing each Other:
We were crawling over the documents in real-time, the key is a shared understanding to make consistent clear edits to convey ideas to others.

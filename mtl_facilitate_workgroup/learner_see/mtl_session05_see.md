## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the team data in the Experiments section.
2. Test out the simulation user-interface for more information about team data.
3. Apply clinical expertise to consider the decisions the team makes that affect these variables.

# Session 5 In-Session Exercise (30 minutes)
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png">

## 1. Copy the name of your team data file using Internet Explorer
a. In session 3, we used "Get Team Data Table for Sim UI" in the data user interface to produce our team data for simulation. We want to grab the filename from there, so in your Explorer browser and go to mtl.how/data.
b. Navigate to the team data_sim_ui folder and click the "..." so you can copy the filename of your team data for the sim UI.

## 2. Log in to the sim UI in Chrome and upload the data file

a. Open a new browser window in Google Chrome and go to mtl.how/sim.

b. Enter your login credentials and click the "Login" button.

c. A box instructing you to *Please select a World* will appear. If you are working collaboratively with your team in *MTL* please select your team world denoted by "team" in the title of the world. If you are exploring the sim UI on your own, please select your individual world denoted by "ind" in the title of the world. Click "Select World."

d. Note: Be aware that this is a responsive web design, meaning that it adjusts the page layout to optimize to your screen's dimensions. For example, if you use your browser control to reduce the window size, the sim UI will adjust to stack these sections vertically instead of showing them side by side. Similarly, if you are logged in on a smartphone or other device, it might look different to you.

## 3. Review the Home page (Team name e, navigation icons, player name; welcome text, and the sections with blue headers)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/gifs/sim_ui_exp_maint.gif)

a. In the Team Data Menu Maintenance section on the right, click Add and paste (Ctrl+V) the filename you saved from the data UI into the box.

## 4. Start a New Session

a. Select the module your team decided to use. 

b. Select the team data you just uploaded.

c. Click Play. For the Care Coordination and Medication Management (CC & MM) modules, you need to select your Learning Mode before you click Play.

## 5. Check out the Sim UI main page.

a. You'll see the same information and buttons at top; 3 sections with blue headers - one showing the module and team data selected in its header; the others headed Outputs and Text, Experiments, and Text.

## 6. Look at your Team Data Table.

a. Expand the Experiments section by clicking on the white down arrow in the right corner of the blue bar. Click on the "i" in the red circle next to Team Data and read the “i” information for the Team Data table.

b. These data come straight from the file we just uploaded. Red = "read in from team data".

c. Click on the "i" button for more information.

d. What types of decisions does the team make that affect these variables?

e. How do the values in this table strike you? Do they line up with how you think things really are?

f. Look for the Team Data Table variables in the system diagram at the left.

## 7. Type a question in the text box.

a. Expand the Outputs and Text section.

b. Type your question into the box.

c. Click Save, and choose "bc" from the first drop-down menu. Click Add, then Save (top right).

d. Log out of the Sim UI.

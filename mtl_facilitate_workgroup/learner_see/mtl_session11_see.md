## Learning Objectives

1. Describe what your team has learned and prioritzed throughout the *MTL* 12-session program.
2. Test how your team's plan aligns with your team's shared vision.
3. Apply decisions that your team has prioritized to implement in the clinic.

# In-session Exercise: *MTL* graduation and post-*MTL* plan (30 minutes)

1. We completed _Modeling to Learn_! Let's review and plan!

2.  What has the team learned throughout the *Modeling to Learn* 12-session program?

3. How will we coordinate our efforts going forward based on our learning?

4. What *MTL* resources will the team use or revisit in the future?

    - *MTL* data UI 
    
    - *MTL* sim UI (which module would be most appropriate to our further need and questions)

5. Lead person(s) and time frame for the above actions 

6. Celebrate completion of *Modeling to Learn*!

## Learning Objectives

1.	Describe what your team has prioritized as decisions to implement in your clinic. 
2.	Test your team’s plan against your individual and shared, team vision.
3.	Apply your team’s plan in clinical decisions.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Connect learning and decisions from experiments to original team vision, question, and need

1.  What shared vision did the team decide on in session 1?

2.  What team need and questions did we identify?

3.  What hypotheses did we test? 

4.  What insights we will keep in mind as we make clinic decisions?

5.  What new approaches or targets do we want to focus on?

6.  What concrete actions can the team take in the real world?

7.  How do these decisions align with the team's shared vision, question and needs?

8.  What data will we watch to see how we're doing?

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe your own vision for what you would like your team to get from *Modeling to Learn.*
2. Test out your thinking with your team about what your shared vision is for becoming a "dream team."
3. Identify a shared team vision for learning from *Modeling to Learn.*

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

### 1. Prior Team Learning Prompt (5 minutes) 

a. Think of a good learning experience in your team. It can be in a meeting or an informal exchange with a colleague. It can be when you learned a clinic procedure, an idea for treatment with a difficult patient, or when a team member unlocked a mystery of CPRS for you. Try to think of a time when you had an ‘aha!’ or something finally made sense, or you could finally do something you couldn’t before.  

b. Jot down on scratch paper what it was that made it a good learning experience. What were the characteristics of the experience? Compile a team list:  

*Most likely the following are true:*   
* The learning was hands-on and experiential.
* The learning connected to the real world.
* The learning experience was personally relevant, interesting, useful, or meaningful to the learner.
* The learner had choices, shared authority, control, and responsibility.
* The learner learned from and taught others.
* The learner had the support he or she needed.
* The learning was individualized. If there were standards for the work, the learner could meet them in his or her own way.
* It was fun or left the learner feeling good.
* The experience helped the learner understand him- or herself.
* The learner experienced success and accomplishment with challenging work,

### 2. Best Case Scenario (5 minutes)

a. Create team language for learning, aligning team decisions when there are roadblocks to consensus. Start by picturing Veteran mental health care in this team as you experience it now – the interactions/communications within the team in and out of team meetings; the key people you rely on outside the team; the information and data you use to coordinate care plans, and the feelings you associate with it.  

b. Now picture the team learning over the next 6 months in a ‘best-case’ scenario, where things are happening in the team the way that you would ideally like them to. This is your “dream team” situation.  

### 3. Personal Vision (5 minutes)  

a. What is team communication like?

b. How does the team relate to one another?

c. How is VA data used?

d. How are decisions, plans and changes made?

### 4. Review in Team (5 minutes)  

a. What stands out to you?

b. Why did we choose these?

c. What makes them so relevant or important to us?

d. Can we address them all (bearing in mind our resources and time)?

e. If not, which would we most like to address (align around), and why?

### 5. Putting it Together (10 minutes)

Overall "Modeling to Learn" objectives include activities and competencies that…

a. …are meaningful for you and align your learning goals with your team.

b. …develop systems thinking skills and help you to see how several things fit together and understand causes that are hard to see without data and modeling resources.

c. …make VA data, initiatives and standards transparent to you. 

d. …empower you to realize ongoing improvements in team quality of care and team quality of work life.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the decisions your team made in producing your team data table.
2. Test out whether your expectations about team historical trends are displayed in the "viz" tabs.
3. Apply your clinical expertise to identify new information about a team patient in the "data" tabs.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

## *MTL* on BISL

### 1. Go to mtl.how/data First select your VISN and then select your facility.
![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/session2_data_ui_3.gif)  

### 2. Explore the information available in the BISL sharepoint splash page
- How many scroll bars are there?  Where are they? 
- Where are the tabs? What can you see by selecting the tabs?
- What filtering options are available? 
- Filter to your clinic or division to see trends for the last two years.

## Your Team Data Folder

### 3. Scroll to your team folder at the bottom of the page. Open the data_ui folder and open your team data ui in Excel.
- Select your station using the control tab. If you have any issues with permissions, Team PSD can help you.
- Click "Get Clinic List" and it will pull in clinics for your facility.
![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/session2_data_ui_1.gif)  

### 4. Go to the ClinicSelection tab. Use columns C-H to select the clinics that make up your team.
- You can sort by Clinic Name, Division Name, Physical Location, Primary and Secondary Stopcode.
- Or, if your team as designated provider clinics, you can select by provider name.
- Note that this will pull all clinics used in the last two years (including de-activated clinics). You can see the de-activated clinics in column I.
- Follow the instructions in **Box A2.** 
- After filtering, you can double-click on clinics to add them to column A or you can highlight the clincis and click the gray "add all" button to add them to column A. 

### 5. To view your team patient data and your team trends. You click on "Get-Patient-level Data." We will not do this in-session today.
- **You have already fresh data UI file to work with already in your team data folder.** 
- We will learn about the "Create Team Data Table for Sim UI" button in our next team meeting.

### NOTE: It takes some time to run a query from your team data UI to the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. 
- On average (depending on the size of your team) it may take 15 minutes or so for your team data UI to pull in fresh data. And, Microsoft Excel will be unresponsive until the data UI has finished pulling in your today.

![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/session2_data_ui_2.gif)

### 6. Click to view the "viz" tabs, which show team trends.
- There are team trends for diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant.
- What stands out to you?
- What is most important to you to check out first?
- what is most surprising?

![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/gifs/session2_data_ui_4_viz_diag.gif)

### 7. Click to view the "data" tabs, which show your team's individual patient information.
- Patients who have requested restricted access to their information have asterisks *******
- Patient information correponds to the same categories as the team trends: diagnoses, encounters, health factor data (e.g., suicide plans, evidence-based practice templates), and measures from mental health assistant.
- Providers can filter to find specific patients, or produce reports. 
- What **data** tab would you use to find out how many current patients on the team are engaged in a specific evidence-based psychotherapy? What column shows you the session number (EBP template) that the patient is on.
- What **viz** tab would you use to see what the most common service encounters or visits are?
- Are there services that have been increasing over time? Are there services that  have been descreasing over time?

## With the team trends (viz) and team patient (data) information in the data UI, your team can efficiently use team meetings to focus on the interrelated issues of care coordination and team quality improvement.

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/learning_objectives.png" height = "90" width = "90" style ="display: inline-block"/> 

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe your team trends over the last two years based on the estimates in the team data table.
2. Test out whether your understanding of how the team data is estimated through review of the descriptions and definitions.
3. Apply your clinical expertise to consider the team trends in the data UI and team data table to identify team priorities for learning.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

### When you click the "Get Team Data Table for Sim UI" button, it produces a table of descriptive team data.
- Data are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team's priorities for learning from *Modeling to Learn*
- There are team data produced for each module of *Modeling to Learn*
- Care Coordination (CC)
- Medication Management (MM)
- Psychotherapy (PSY)
- Aggregate team services (AGG)
- *Measurement-based stepped care for suicide prevention - coming in fall 2018*

### 1. Select a service for review
- Find a variable that is important to you team. How is it estimated in this table? What are it's units?
- Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?
- Check out columns C and D. What is the difference between these two columns?

### 2. Select a second service for review
- Check out columns C and D. What is the difference between these two columns?
- Find a variable that is important to you team. How is it estimated in this table? What are it's units?
- Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?

### 3. Are there any team data table values you would like to explore in the team data UI?
- If so, which ones? Open the data UI to examine your question.

### 4. Does the team see any values in the team data that seem to vary significantly from expectations?
- If so, what is it surprising? Does the estimation definition help you to interpret the variable value?

### 5. Does the team see any values in the team data that fit your expectations about high priority team needs?
- If so, what are you noticing? In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day clinical practice in your team?

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

1. Complete the [*MTL* Menu](https://mtl.how/menu) on your own.

2. Review the team's results in your team. 
- What stands out to you?

3. Look for areas of consensus among the team. 
- What does the team agree about?

4. Discuss items in which team members varied a lot in their rankings. 
- Where does the team have more variable perspectives?

5. Focus on the high priority needs to select a module for sessions 5-10 of *Modeling to Learn*
What is the highest priority need for your team now?

These are the *MTL* available modules
- Care Coordination (CC)
- Medication Management (MM)
- Psychotherapy (PSY)
- Aggregrate team services (AGG)
- Measurement-based stepped care for suicide prevention (SP)

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the systems story of your team's highest priority. 
2. Test out your thinking about causes of team challenges using the model diagram.
3. Apply clinical expertise to develop a question for team learning using simulation.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

* Purpose: The purpose for this activity is to familiarize MTL learners with the main section in the model diagram. By the end, learners should easily find information in the model.  

# **In-session Exercise – Part 1: Where in the MTL World Is…**  

* The Facilitator will challenge MTL learners to find certain information on the mtl.how/sim main section.
+ A series of 5 questions, one at a time, will be posed via the chat box as well as the Facilitator reading them aloud to the MTL Learners.  
+ Find the answer and “chat” it back to the Facilitator by typing your answer into the chat box.  
+ *If at any time you are not sure how to find something, ask for help.* The Facilitator will provide assistance by sending a hint or giving verbal support to all participants.  

1. Question 1: Over what timeframe does an experiment "run?"  
2. Question 2: Where do you find the descriptions for each variable in the module? Paste a portion of a description from one of the *Rates* into the chat box.  
3. Question 3: Describe in one sentence what happens in the model as you "Reveal Complexity?"  
4. Question 4: What is the significance of the variables in the "red boxes?"

# **In-session Exercise – Part 2: Telling a Systems Story**  

* MTL learners will form pairs.  
* Starting Point: Main model section with no complexity revealed.  
*Tip for the learner* – if your computer screen is expanded you may not be able to see the whole model all at once. If you click on expand screen button for your browser to full screen view, it will enable you to see the whole model at once.  

* With your partner, imagine a veteran in care. Together, review the system story and complete four tasks:  
1. Document: As you talk through the model, document (make notes) where you have questions or are unsure about the relationships you are seeing in the model.
2. Review Appointments Section. While doing this, one partner should describe to the other partner the connections between *Booking Rate*, *Return-to-Clinic Visit Interval* (RVI) and *Appointments for Existing Patients*.  How do these variables impact one another? 
3. Review Patients Section. One partner should walk the other through the loop connecting *Referral Rate*, *Waiting to Start* and *Target Wait Time?* How does the loop work or flow?  
4. Partners should discuss the connection between the main section and the team data table. How are they linked?

* Large Group Debrief: 
+ Team PSD will call up on the pairs to tell the system story.
+ As the story is revealed, *MTL Learners* should raise issues and questions documented during the *Telling a Systems Story* activity.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

## Running an Experiment

1.	Login to your team world at mtl.how/sim.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/gifs/sim_ui_1.gif)

2.	Review your saved runs. Rename your saved runs if you feel you need to.

3.	Review the data files you have uploaded for use and make sure you have what you want.

4.	You can *Join Current Session* or *Start a New Session* in any module. If you *Start a New Session* select the team data file you’d like to use.

5.	To refresh your memory and pick up where you left off last time, select the experiment from the last session and check the box to include text from this session in Expanded Outputs text fields. Review those text fields.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/gifs/sim_ui_7.gif)

6.	Study the system diagram and team data, and decide together what change you want to experiment with, that might give you the desired result.

7.	To create a new run building off of the previous one, revise the text in all the text boxes to reflect the experiment you want to do now: 

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.*

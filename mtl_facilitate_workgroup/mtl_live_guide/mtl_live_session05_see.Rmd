## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the team data in the experiments tile.
2. Test out the simulation user-interface for more information about team data.
3. Apply clinical expertise to consider the decisions the team makes that affect these variables.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

# Session 5 In-Session Exercise

1. Log in to the SimUI.

+ Open a new browser window and go to mtl.how/SIM.

+ Enter your login credentials and hit enter.

2. Orient yourself to the landing page (Team name, navigation icons, player name, welcome text, tiles with blue headers).

3. Start a New Session

+ Select the Care Coordination module. 

+ Select the team data you want to use.

+ Click Play.

4. Orient yourself to the Main Page of the SimUI (same information and buttons at top; 3 tiles with blue headers - one showing the module and team data selected in its header; the others headed Outputs and Experiments).

5. Expand the Experiments tile and read the “i” information for the Team Data Table.

+ What types of decisions does the team make that affect these variables?

+ How do the values in this table strike you? Do they line up with how you think things really are?

6. Find the Team Data Table variables in the system diagram at the left.

+ True Missed Appointment % (rate)

+ Appointment Supply

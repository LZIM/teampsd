## Learning Objectives

1.	Describe what your team has prioritized as decisions to implement in your clinic. 
2.	Test your team’s plan against your individual and shared, team vision.
3.	Apply team your team’s plan in clinical decisions.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

1. Last experiment - i.e. Experiment on how to use RVI to address loss of staff 

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.* 

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.*

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_findings.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Findings.** *Describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from this experiment.* 

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_decisions.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Decisions.** *Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice?* 

2. Review experiments, think about them in relationship to team needs and team vision
3. Thinking about which patients team would push out (linking back to the Data UI)
4. Bridge back learning from experiments to original learning goal, team question, and team need into concrete actions team can take in the real world
5. Stitching team back together. Trying to find ways for team to coodinate efforts based on learning, with access to resources and ability to go on with another module if interested.
6. We do not want to send the message when making the team plan that we are finally making a decision for the first time after meeting for 6 months. We want team to be making and thinking about decisions and changes all along the way.

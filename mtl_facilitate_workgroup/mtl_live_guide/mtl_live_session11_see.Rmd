## Learning Objectives

1.	Describe what your team has prioritized as decisions to implement in your clinic. 
2.	Test your team’s plan against your individual and shared, team vision.
3.	Apply your team’s plan in clinical decisions.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

1. Review experiments; bridge back learning from experiments to original learning goal/team vision, team question, and team need
2. Identify concrete actions team can take in the real world
3. What are the priority insights we will keep in mind as we make clinic decision
4. What new approaches or targets do we want to focus on
5. What data will we watch to see how we're doing
6. How will we coordinate our efforts going forward based on learning

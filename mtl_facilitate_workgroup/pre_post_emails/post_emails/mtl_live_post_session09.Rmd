|**At Our Next Team Meeting**|

**Experiment 2**
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/> **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.*
For experiment 2, we will try to step more patients down out of psychotherapy/EBPsy who are engaged for greater than 3 months.
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/> **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.* 
We expect that if we reduce the median engagement >3 months to 12 visits (meaning a 75% reduction), then it will free up "a lot" of appointment space, so we can start "more" new patients.
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_findings.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/> **Our Findings.** *Describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from this experiment.*
Against the base case:  Our starting rate increased from ~3 ppw to 7 ppw.  We went from having ~4 apw  to ~8 apw.  
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_decisions.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/> **Our Decisions.** *Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice?*  
We decided to run a third experiment on your own in your individual world. So that next time we are prepared to think through new decisions we might make in our team.    |

## Reschedule 9/7 meeting.  
Normally we would meet next on 9/7. However,the TeamPSD facilitators will be in Chicago for MTL Facilitate training. We can reschedule on the ***2nd Friday - September 14 @8am*** or meet next at our typical meeting on the ***3rd Friday - September 21 @8am***.
Please let us know what would make the most sense for your team.  

As a reminder, we are wrapping up Modeling to Learn. Thanks for piloting and learning with us!    
**Wrap Up #1:** Team Reflections and Decisions – Implementing a change in the team based on lessons learned and reflections from the simulation.   
**Wrap Up #2:** Technical Assistance Plans & Resources for Self-Directed Learning – Providing teams with resources, guides, and videos for developing and running future experiments.  
**Booster Sessions (Optional):**  Developing hypothesis and experiments to run in a new module  

Thanks!

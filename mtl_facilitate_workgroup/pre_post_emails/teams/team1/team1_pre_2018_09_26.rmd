What happens when we cut the engagement duration by 75%?
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/> **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.* 
We'll be able to start more patients than when we increased the graduation rate.

We are able to start ~3 more patients per week (about double the current rate!).
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_decisions.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/> **Our Decisions.** *Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice?*  
For clients on the cusp of being done, more tempted to graduate them..."might push out a small percentage a little sooner"  |

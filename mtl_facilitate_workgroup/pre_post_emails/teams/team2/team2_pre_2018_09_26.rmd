|**At Our Last Team Meeting**|
| [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/logos/mtl_how_sim.png" height = "45" width = "75">](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Team Lead ran Experiment 2 and we compared bc, exp 1, and exp 3 using the Control Panel of the Expanded Outputs Tile.** |
|[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/logos/mtl_how_sim.png" height = "45" width = "75">](http://mtl.how/sim) **Logged to mtl.how/sim to run an 3rd experiment on your own in your individual world before team meeting.**|
**Experiment 2**
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/> **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.*
What happens if we lose two providers AND then reduce how we make patient triage decisions -- to send half as many people to PSY and CC as we did before the hours for those services were also cut in half?
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/> **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.* 
We expect that wait times will not go up as much, as we have cut demand for those services.
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_findings.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/> **Our Findings.** *Describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from this experiment.*
We found RVI for PSY stretched way out to several weeks between visits and work pressure increased really quickly then came back down. Saw far less pts in PSY over next 2 years. 
<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_decisions.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/> **Our Decisions.** *Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice?*  
Decision is for people to experiment with sensitivity sliders on own and follow up.   |

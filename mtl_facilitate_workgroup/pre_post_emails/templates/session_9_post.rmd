**Team Learning Goal:**    
**Next Meeting:**  
**Meeting Info:** mtl.how/live | 1-800-767-1750; Code 27379  

As a reminder, we only have two sessions of Modeling to Learn remaining. In those, we will cover:   
**Wrap Up #1:** Team Reflections and Decisions – Implementing a change in the team based on lessons learned and reflections from the simulation.    
**Wrap Up #2:** Technical Assistance Plans & Resources for Self-Directed Learning – Providing teams with resources, guides, and videos for developing and running future experiments.   
**Booster Sessions (Optional):**  Developing hypothesis and experiments to run in a new module   

Thanks for piloting and learning with us!

| --- | We saw that we can increase our new patient starts by ~50%, if we graduate all patients who receive a complete timely dose of psychotherapy. As you meet with patients over the next 2-4 weeks, think about which patient you'd be comfortable talking with about graduation. |

{ } Signifies content to be added by Team PSD for the final Manual.  
[ ] Signifies explanatory notes and instructions for the facilitator; i.e. things they do not say out loud during session. This content stays in final Manual. How it will be designated/formatted is tbd; GHPC recommendation is that it be in RED font vs. black for script.

# Session 1: Shared Vision 
## FACILITATOR PREP & FOLLOW-UP
### Overview
We all learn best when we seek to accomplish things that matter to us. Today we want to clarify what we are trying to accomplish together with “Modeling to Learn.” We want this learning process to be something you can commit to because it reflects a key part your own vision for care in this team.  

Identifying a shared purpose can be deeply motivating, it requires mutual respect to find common ground and it is something to be created over time together, not just one time.  

That said, we want to take a few moments to begin to identify a shared purpose about what we are trying to achieve with this time. The team learning goal provides the focus and energy for committing to learning together over time. We have limited time, we want to identify what is most central to team learning goals and connect or to daily team care delivery.  

What is (retrospective data) versus what we would like it to be (future oriented). Team learning is all about ‘alignment’ and getting people working in synch with one another to meet the needs of our Veteran patients.  

Moving from “my vision” to “our vision” for continual team learning and improved care coordination, shift your paradigm towards how things could be done.  

With a shared vision everyone has a common destination and a common picture. They then work together as a team, supporting and encouraging each other. There is no competition between people, therefore there is no need to pass blame or hide your failures.  

Team lead and a facilitation team to figure our “What’s better?” in a way that reflects common team aspirations.

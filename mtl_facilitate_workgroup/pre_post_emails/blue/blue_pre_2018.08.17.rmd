## 8/17 and 9/7 meeting cancelled.
Normally we would meet tomorrow 8/17 and next on 9/7. However, all of the TeamPSD facilitators are unavailable to meet tomorrow and we will be in Chicago the first week of September training TAS in the MTL program.   
Please let us know what would make the most sense for your team to reschedule these two meetings:  
*4th Friday - August 24 @8am*  
*5th Friday - August 31 @8am*  
*2nd Friday - September 14 @8am*

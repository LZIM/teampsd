## Intersession Checklist


#### Facilitator goals for prep between sessions: ####

1) Divvy up in-session tasks - who will do what (e.g., cover the do/done, review the hypothesis from last meeting).
 - Co-facilitation model of Live Lead vs. Pre/Post lead and Session Note Taker. Clarify who will say which pieces and cover which tasks. We have learned that if this is not clarified exactly, items fall through the cracks and time is not spent efficiently.

2) Review target time stamps for the session - what will you cover by when in the meeting.
 - Write down exact time stamps matching the script of how the session will be paced. Co-facilitators should help each other stay on track for time.

3) Review the targeted next level of systems thinking in the question, hypothesis, findings and decisions boxes for that session.
  - We want to further the systems thinking skills of the team with each session, specifically these four attributes:
       + Complex - **Forest not trees.** Relationships among two or more variables (wait times, improvement rate), or two or more settings (primary care, general mental health).
      + Feedback - **Loop not line. Not simple cause and effect.** The end of the story often influences the beginning, and is strengthened (reinforcing) or reduced (balancing) around the loop.
      + System Behavior - **Movie not snapshot.** Trends over time.  Systems cause their own behavior through feedback.
      + Time - **Short and long term.** Better understanding of change over time (e.g., worse before better, better before worse).

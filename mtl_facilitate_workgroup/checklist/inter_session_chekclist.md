## Intersession Checklist


#### Facilitator goals bewteen each session: ####

1) Divvy up in-session tasks - who will do what (e.g., cover the do/done, review the hypothesis from last meeting).
 - Co-facilitation model of Live Lead vs. Pre/Post lead and Session Note Taker. Clarify who will say which pieces and cover which tasks. We have learned that if this is not clarified exactly, items fall through the cracks and time is not spent efficiently.

2) Review target time stamps for the session - what will you cover by when in the meeting.
 - Write down exact time stamps matching the script of how the session will be paced. Co-facilitators should help each other stay on track for time.

3) Review the targeted next level of systems thinking in the question, hypothesis, findings and decisions boxes for that session.
 - We want to further the systems thinking skills of the team with each session

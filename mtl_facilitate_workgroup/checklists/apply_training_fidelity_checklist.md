- [ ] 4. We are supporting shared team decision-making in this project.

## B. Intersession checklist prioritizing Post-session Checklist items 6, 7 & 9 (short-form)

### 6. What is the team's guiding question and hypotheses? (what are they testing?)

#### BUILD & APPLY (s5-10) Intersession Checklist Priorities

_CONSIDER THESE QUESTIONS_
- **NEED: Current working conceptualization of this team's need based on the 4 priorities below?**  _______________________________________

- **DIFFERENTIATE: I need to rule in  _______________________________________ or rule out  _______________________________________ during this session to refine my conceptualization and prepare for the next session (based on growing consensus and capacity building with this team).**

- **My GOAL for this session is that the team will document the following Q/H/F/D by end of the session.**

**Question: _______________________________________** 

**Hypothesis: _______________________________________** 

**Findings: _______________________________________** 

**Decisions: _______________________________________** 

1. Specific values from the Team Data table (sessions 2,3 & 5) that are guiding the in-session work to address the team's highest priority need. _______________________________________

2. Complexity reveal (causal loop) most relevant to the team's highest priority need is: _______________________________________

3. Specific value adjustments you expect will be helpful for the team to experiment with related to their highest priority need: _______________________________________ 

**Experiment (Session)** | **Variable(s) & Value(s) in BC** | **Variable(s) and Value Adjustment(s) in Experiment**
-- | -- | -- 
**Exp 1 (s8)** | _______________________________________ | _______________________________________  
**Exp 2 (s9)** | _______________________________________  | _______________________________________ 
**Exp 3 (s10)** | _______________________________________  | _______________________________________ 

4. Output charts (system behaviors) you're going to check and discuss as a team in relation to their team's highest priority need: _______________________________________

**Sessions MTL focuses on improving systems thinking among frontline teams making care decisions.**

Systems Thinking | Definition
-- | -- 
Complex | **Forest   not trees.**    Relationships among two or more   variables _______________________________________  [Tailor examples to the team: e.g., wait times, improvement rate], or two or more settings  _______________________________________  [Tailor examples to the team: e.g. primary   care, general mental health].
Feedback | **Loop not line.**    Not simple cause and effect. The end of   the story often influences the beginning, and is strengthened (reinforcing) _______________________________________ [Tailor to key reinforcing "systems story" for this team] or reduced (balancing) (reinforcing) _______________________________________ [Tailor to key balancing "systems story" for this team] around the loop.
System Behavior | **Movie   not snapshot.**    Trends over time.    Systems cause their own behavior through feedback._______________________________________ [Tailor to team: Key system behavior output #1 for team] _______________________________________ [Tailor to team: Key system behavior output #2 for team] _______________________________________ [Tailor to team: Key system behavior output #3 for team] _______________________________________ [Tailor to team: Key system behavior output #4 for team] 
Time | **Short   _and_   long term.**      Better understanding of change over   time   (e.g., worse before better, better   before worse)._______________________________________ [Tailor to team: System behavior output #1 pattern over next two years] _______________________________________ [Tailor to team: System behavior output #2 pattern over next two years] _______________________________________ [Tailor to team: System behavior output #3 pattern over next two years] _______________________________________ [Tailor to team: System behavior output #4 pattern over next two years]

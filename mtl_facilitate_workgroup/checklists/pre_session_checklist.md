# MTL Facilitate Pre-Session Checklist

## 1. Decide who will be the Prep Lead and who will be the Live Lead.
 
+ Prep Lead: 

    a. Open the Team Tracker card for the session at [mtl.how/team_tracker](mtl.how/team_tracker) for team details prepped during intersession prep.
    
    b. for a list of relevant 1) platforms and 2) guides/checklists to prep for each session. [*This instruction needs work.*]

+ Live Lead:

  a. Open the [SEE file](https://mtl.how) at mtl.how for learners.
  
  b. Open the [SAY checklist](https://_____) at mtl.how/blue 

## 2. Divide in-session tasks

  + Who will do what e.g., cover the do/done, learning objectives, review the hypothesis from last meeting
  + Note specific time stamps on the [team_tracker checklist or is it the say checklist?](https://mtl.how/team_tracker)

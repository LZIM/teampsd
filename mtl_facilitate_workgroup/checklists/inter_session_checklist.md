## Intersession Facilitation Checklist - Used by Co-Facilitators to prepare between Team Meetings

## Intersession Resources and Tasks
1. The **intersession _checklist_** provides co-facilitator guidance for tailoring the  MTL 12-session plan to their team.
2. The **intersession _meeting_** uses the intersession checklist to prioritize and practice tailoring the SAY files to your team within the timestamps according to the _MTL_ theory of change.
3. **Intersession preparation** should help you to _prioritize_ and _practice_ key emphases of **participatory learning** and **systems thinking** related to the team's highest priority need from session 1 through session 12 of the 12-session plan.

## Facilitation Goals and Emphases _MTL_ Across the 12-Session plan

_MTL_ Sessions | Primary Goal | Emphais | Team Time Report
-- | -- | -- | --
**s1-4** | Partner to identify the team's highest priority learning need now. | participatory learning | **tt1**
**s5-s8** | Build capacity for participatory learning from simulation using team question/hypothesis/findings/decisions | participatory learning + systems thinking | **tt2**
**s9-12** | Use C.F.B.T. Systems Thinking and plan for future team learning needs. | systems thinking | **tt3**
 
 
## s1-4 - Partner to identify the team's highest priority learning need now. [participatory learning]
- Introduce the overarching _MTL_ Learning Objectives and identify a shared team vision for _Modeling to Learn_.
- Review hypoer local transparent team data resources related to the team's learning vision.
- Dialogue about the team's highest priority learning need now using the _MTL Menu_

Session | Priority| Participatory Learning 
s1 | Shared Vision | The team practices making team decisions as they move from an individual to shared vision, select their team lead and team meeting time
s2 | Team Data | The team learns to build their own team data for evaluating team trends and patient data in relation to their team vision.
s3 | Team Data for Simulation | The team reviews "What is" team parameters related to their team vision and considers the benefits of "what if" simulation learning.
s4 | Team Need | The engages in a dialogue about the highest priority team need now, so that there is consensus around the _MTL_ Learning Module selected for sessions 5-10.

## s5-8 - Build capacity for participatory learning from simulation using team question/hypothesis/findings/decisions [participatory learning + systems thinking]
- Review the _MTL_ Fidelity Checklist to identify the additional participatory learning capacities for each session.
- We want the team to build capacities to use _MTL_ without facilitation in the future.

Session | Capacity | Participatory Learning + Systems Thinking
-- | -- | -- 
s5 | **Experiments Section & Text**| Enter the Team's Learning Question based on the needs assessment and team data.
s6 | **Tell a Systems Story** | Enter a Dynamic Hypothesis based on Systems story 
s7 | **Test a Dynamic Hypothesis** | Test the Dynamic Hypothesis for the Base Case and Write up the Findings and Decisions
s8 | **Compare Alternatives** | Test Dynamic Hypothesis for an alternative and write up the comparison against the Basecase in Findings and Decisions.

## s9-12 - Use C.F.B.T. Systems Thinking and plan for future team learning needs. [systems thinking]
- Review the targeted next level of systems thinking for the team based on their question, hypothesis, findings and decisions boxes for that session.
- We want to further the systems thinking skills of the team with each session, specifically these four C.F.B.T. attributes:

C.F.B.T. | Systems Thinking | Considers
-- | -- | --
Complex | **Forest not trees.** | Relationships among two or more variables (wait times, improvement rate), or two or more settings (primary care, general mental health).
Feedback | **Loop not line. Not simple cause and effect.** | The end of the story often influences the beginning, and is strengthened (reinforcing) or reduced (balancing) around the loop.
System Behavior | **Movie not snapshot.** | Trends over time.  Systems cause their own behavior through feedback.
|Time | **Short and long term.** | Better understanding of change over time (e.g., worse before better, better before worse).

### Intersession Tasks

1) **Divvy up in-session tasks - who will do what during today's meeting and during the live team meeting (e.g., cover the do/done, review the hypothesis from last meeting).**
- Co-facilitation model of Live Lead vs. Pre/Post lead and Session Note Taker. Clarify who will say which pieces and cover which tasks. - - We have learned that if this is not clarified in advance and practiced, then items fall through the cracks and time is not spent efficiently.

2) **Review and practice target time stamps for the session - what will you cover by when in the meeting.**
 - Consider the time stamps matching the script of how the session will be paced. 
 - What will you prioritize to adhere to _MTL_ Fidelity while also tailoring to the team's highest priority need?
 - Co-facilitators should help each other stay on track for time.

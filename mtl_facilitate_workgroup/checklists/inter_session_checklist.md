# Intersession Facilitation Checklist 

### Purpose
- **The intersession checklist is used by Co-Facilitators to ensure the substantive goals and emphases of the _MTL_ theory of change are prioritized and practiced when tailoring to your team's highest priority need.**

1. The intersession **_checklist_** provides co-facilitator guidance for tailoring the  MTL 12-session plan to their team.
2. The intersession **_meeting_** uses the intersession checklist to prioritize and practice tailoring the SAY files to your team within the timestamps according to the _MTL_ theory of change.
3. Intersession **_preparation_** should help you to prioritize and practice key emphases of **participatory learning** and **systems thinking** related to the team's priority need from session 1 through session 12 of the 12-session plan.

### Before you begin
#### There are four steps to prioritize and practice when tailoring your SAY guide to your team:

1. **Download or print** to fill in blanks and brackets to relate to your team's highest priority need.
2. **Review post-session checklist** notes **especially #6** from the prior session and review the **_MTL_ Fidelity Checklist** 
3. **Apply the 4 "prioritize prompts** from thhe interssion guide to the SAY file 
4. **Clarify Co-Facilitator Roles** - Choose a "**_Live Lead_**" (drives on-screen until handing off to the team lead) and a "**_Fidelity Facilitator_**" (ensures that key goals and priorities are emphasized on-time to maintain fidelity)."
5. **Practice your priorities** from the interssion guide using the intersession and SAY file timestamps.

### Facilitation Goals and Emphasis Across the 12-Session plan

_MTL_ Sessions | Primary Goal | Emphasis | Team Time Report
-- | -- | -- | --
**1-4** | Partner to identify and validate the team's highest priority learning need now. | participatory learning | **tt1**
**5-8** | Build capacity for participatory learning from simulation using team question/hypothesis/findings/decisions | participatory learning + systems thinking | **tt2**
**9-12** | Use C.F.B.T. Systems Thinking and plan for future team learning needs. Ideally: Team is ready to implement a tested change in the real world| systems thinking | **tt3**


### Sesson 1-4 - Partner to identify the team's highest priority learning need now. [participatory learning]
- Introduce the overarching _MTL_ Learning Objectives and identify a shared team vision for _Modeling to Learn_.
- Review hyper local transparent team data resources related to the team's learning vision.
- Dialogue about the team's highest priority learning need now using the _MTL Menu_

Session | Priority| Participatory Learning 
-- | -- | --
s1 | Shared Vision | The team practices making team decisions as they move from an individual to shared vision, select their team lead and team meeting time
s2 | Team Data Trends | The team learns to evaluate their own team data trends and patient data in relation to their team vision.
s3 | Team Data for Simulation | The team selects the data that makes sense for their own context and shared vision, and builds the set of parameters they will use for "what if" simulation learning.
s4 | Team Need | The team engages in a dialogue about the highest priority team need now, so that there is consensus around the _MTL_ Learning Module selected for sessions 5-10.

### Sesson 5-8 - Build capacity for participatory learning from simulation using team question/hypothesis/findings/decisions [participatory learning + systems thinking]
- Review the _MTL_ Fidelity Checklist to identify the additional participatory learning capacities for each session.
- We want the team to build capacities to use _MTL_ without facilitation in the future.

Session | Capacity | Participatory Learning + Systems Thinking
-- | -- | -- 
s5 | **Experiments Section & Text**| Enter the Team's Learning Question based on the needs assessment and team data.
s6 | **Tell a Systems Story** | Enter a Dynamic Hypothesis based on Systems story 
s7 | **Test a Dynamic Hypothesis** | Test the Dynamic Hypothesis for the Base Case and Write up the Findings and Decisions
s8 | **Compare Alternatives** | Test Dynamic Hypothesis for an alternative and write up the comparison against the Basecase in Findings and Decisions.

### Sesson 9-12 - Use C.F.B.T. Systems Thinking and plan for future team learning needs and ready team to implement a tested change in the real world. [systems thinking]
- Review the targeted next level of systems thinking for the team based on their question, hypothesis, findings and decisions boxes for that session.
- We want to further the systems thinking skills of the team with each session, specifically these four C.F.B.T. attributes:

C.F.B.T. | Systems Thinking | Considers
-- | -- | --
Complex | **Forest not trees.** | Relationships among two or more variables (wait times, improvement rate), or two or more settings (primary care, general mental health).
Feedback | **Loop not line. Not simple cause and effect.** | The end of the story often influences the beginning, and is strengthened (reinforcing) or reduced (balancing) around the loop.
System Behavior | **Movie not snapshot.** | Trends over time.  Systems cause their own behavior through feedback.
|Time | **Short and long term.** | Better understanding of change over time (e.g., worse before better, better before worse).

### Team Tailoring and _MTL_ Theory of Change

### Prioritize

**1. Customize the Facilitator SAY guide for your individual team.** 

- **Download or print** to fill in blanks and brackets to relate to their priority need to the highest priorities your practiced related to the _MTL_ theory of change. 

- **Review post-session checklist** notes **especially #6** from the prior session and review the **_MTL_ Fidelity Checklist** 

- **Prioritize continuity across sessions** from the **team vision,** **team data** and **team need.** (MTL sessions 1-4).
from session to session, (“last time we talked about…”; “so-and-so asked about…”). 
- This is essential for ensuring fidelity to the _MTL_ Theory of Change.

### Practice

**2. Rehearse the next session using the checklists above.**

- **Clarify Co-Facilitator Roles** - Choose a Live Lead and a Pre/Post Lead/Note-taker. 

- **Practice the highest priorities from the interesssion checklist** - ensure they can be communicated to the time within the timestamps.
     -    Align the team-specific tailoring with the **goals** and **emphases** of the sessions according the **_MTL_ Theory of Change.**
     -    Practice to make sure your examples work within the time-frame. Specific examples, results of data inquiries, sim experiments, etc., should relate to the team's need, be interpretable, and support their hypothesis. If not, prepare to explain.
     -    Quiz each other on FAQ/anticipated questions from the team for the upcoming session.
     
3. **Review details** -  make sure there are no technical concerns or back-end administrative tasks outstanding.

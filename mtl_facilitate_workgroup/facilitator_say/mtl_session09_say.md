## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes you expect to observe in your experiment.
2. Test your dynamic hypothesis about your team's clinical priority.
3. Apply systems thinking to describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from your experiment.

### Let's get started:

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Comparing experiments 1 and 2

**1. Review Past Experiment**

  + We're going to pull up experiment 1. To do this, let's log in to the team world at mtl.how/sim.  Type in your name and password, then hit “Join Current Session.” Pull up past experiments and text by clicking on the blue “Output” header, and then the “Expand” icon in the upper middle.  Scroll down, and click on the drop down list under “Select Experiment” in the “Control Panel.”  Select your base case experiment for Alternative 1, and your previous experiment for Alternative 2.  

  + Looking at the charts here in the Expanded Outputs section, ask “What did we learn last time?”  *If the team needs prompting, then ask them to click on the question mark that is just above the drop-down list and read out their Question, Hypothesis, Findings, and Decisions from their last experiment.*  

**2.  Plan for Experiment 2**  

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.* 

  + Before we run Experiment 2, our team needs to discuss “What new idea do we want to test this week?”  
    ++ We need to minimize the Expanded Outputs by clicking on the “box” in the upper right corner of the window, so we can see both the model and type text into the *Our Question* and the *Our Hypothesis* boxes.  
    
  + Ask the team for text to type into the *Our Question* box. The question should clearly state a directional change in at least one variable.  
  
  **CC**: What will happen to the Starting Rate and New Patient Wait Time if we lengthen our team's average Return to Clinic Interval (in weeks) by a certain amount?  
  
  **MM**: How do we best allocate our x waiver appointments to serve 4 new OUD patients per week?  
  
  **PSY**: For experiment 2, we ask: What is the effect of increasing the number of Initiators who Complete from the base case rate of 37% to 75% on the number of patients who complete and graduate?  
  
  **AGG**: If we lose two MHTC/psychotherapists, what is the impact on medication management?  
  
  **SP**: What if we implemented stepped care between our clinic and PC/PCMHI?


[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.*

  + Research into experiential learning with simulation has shown that it is more impactful if the group “stakes a claim” before seeing the results of a possible future scenario.  
    ++ Ask, “What do you think the effects will be of this change?  How much better will things get?”  Push the team to be as specific as possible, both with their change and the result.  
    ++ Type these variables and predictions into the “Our Hypothesis” box.  
    
  **CC**:  H - Increasing the Return Visit Interval will have the effect of increasing the Appointment Supply for New CC Patients by decreasing the Appointments for Existing Patients. Just as in Experiment 1, the increased Appointment Supply for New CC Patients will increase the Starting Rate and decrease New Patient Wait Times. But decreasing the Appointments for Existing Patients will also lower the Completing Rate for CC patients.  
  
  **MM**: If we increase our proportion of appointments with an X waiver to 10%, then it will increase the starting rate.  
  
  **PSY**: We hypothesize that increasing the number of Initiators who complete from the base case rate of 37% to 75% will have a moderate increase in the number of patients who complete and graduate compared to the base case.  
  
  **AGG**: We are increasing the proportion of our services for med management by 25% and increasing telephone services by 25%. This is likely increasing work pressure. This it will increase no-shows and wait times for med management. (Sensitivity of Patient's Engagement Time to Provider Fatigue, Sensitivity of Scheduled Return Visit Interval to Work Pressure, Sensitivity of Overtime to Work Pressure)  
  **SP**: With this change, clinicians in both settings will be more likely to step their patients between the two settings, as all the confusion and negotiation needed to step a patient between these settings will have been removed – now, if a GMH patient is low symptom, then they will spend less time in GMH before their provider recommends stepping down to PC, and for high symptom patients in PC, they will spend less time there before clinicians there recommend stepping up to GMH. We expect this smoother flow between the two settings to decrease the number of patients waiting to step between the two settings. For PC, they will be able to step more high symptom patients up to the right level of care sooner, so the number of patients in PC with a high risk flag will start to decline. For GMH, we will be able to step more low-symptom patients down to PC, creating more openings, and thus increase our access.  
  
  + Now, ask the team why this will happen. Reveal complexities in the model diagram to support the team telling the systems story supporting the causal relationship between their change and their expected result. The hypotheses must track the effects of an initial change through the system, following the causal arrows in the model diagram.  
  
  + Example: Reducing the Missed Appointment % will cause the amount of rework to decrease, and the total number of appointments on the calendar will drop.  This will free up provider time, and allow more hours to go toward starting new patients.  This in turn will add more patients to the team, and eventually the team will fill up all the extra slots, and the start rate will balance out at a new, but higher, rate than before.  

**3.  Run Experiment 2**  
  + Restate the change to be tested, and move the Text box with the Question and Hypothesis text to the left, in order to reveal the experiment sliders.  Move each slider named in the question to its desired value, and click  the green “Run” icon.  Name this run according to the variables you changed.  
  
  + To name the run, click on the down arrow next to Variable, choose the variable name you changed, for example, Appointment Supply or Return Visit Interval. Click *Add*. This will insert an abbreviation of that variable into the experiment name. Next, click on the down arrow next to Number, choose the number that represents the new value you used in your experiment.  Finally, click *Save* (not Save & Reset, just Save). The date will automatically be added to the name of the saved experiment.  

**4. Compare Results**  

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_findings.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Findings.** *Describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from this experiment.*  

  + Now that you’ve run the scenario, ask the team what variables they should look at.  They will want to know 1) Did their experiment have the predicted result? And 2) Did their systems story in the hypothesis box explain these results?  First, expand the “Outputs” by clicking on the white box in the upper right corner.  Charts for six key variables should already be shown in the “Results Dashboard.”  If other variables are needed, then click into the drop-down under any chart to select another variable.  

  + Ask the team for text to type into the “Findings” box, now just above the “Results Dashboard.”  These findings must be specific about both the quantitative impact of their experiment and how those results were produced.  
      
  **CC**:  **AFTER RVI QUANTITY IN EXPERIMENT SECTION IN CC MODULE IS CORRECTED, WE CAN RUN EXP 2 AND INSERT FINDINGS TEXT HERE**  
  
  **MM**: Well, our fears are confirmed: if we increase the proportion of x-waiver slots to 10%, it does increase the starting rate for OUD MM to about 1 patient/month. But it also increased the wait times for patients with other needs.  
  
  **PSY**: Against the base case, we found that the total number of patients served by the team stayed the same (N=371). Of the 371, n=249 were Initiators and n=187 were Completers. Among Completers, n=7 graduated and were done. Regarding the starting rate for new patients, it decreased compared to our base case and our Experiment 1.  
  
  **AGG**: Patients waiting to start oscillates. Work pressure spikes in about 3 months.  
  
  **SP**: Start rates in GMH and PC increase (from 12 to 16 pts/week, then settling at 13; and ~6.5 to 8 pts/wk, settling at 7.5, respectively). Primary Care is able to reduce both the number of high-symptom patients in their care, and the number of patients with a high risk flag. Even with the increase in the Recommend Step Up Rate, wait time before actually stepping up to GMH falls.
However, the unintended consequence of implementing stepped care, this is not the case for patients trying to step down from GMH: as more patients are recommended to step down to PC, the actual start rate in PC does not increase enough to accommodate all these new patients. Why? Even though the effect on flow between the two settings was the same (ie, Time to Recommend was cut in both settings by 50%), the size of the two settings is not– GMH can maintain over 500 patients in treatment, while PC can only maintain 300. Implementing Stepped Care between these two settings with a substantial size difference will mean more patients trying to flow from GMH to PC than from PC to GMH. Thus, the resulting wait time to step down from GMH to PC practically doubles over the next two years. Also, the ratio of high symptom patients to low in GMH slightly increases, as it is easier to step low symptom patients down to PC than before. Not all wait times for starting PC have increased, though. Both new patients and patients stepping down from Specialty Mental Health see their wait times reduced (new patients to near zero!). This suggests that PC has options, and can re-allocate their openings to better balance incoming patients’ needs. Reallocating their openings can’t fix everything, as the inflows from new and SMH are only 1/5 (each) as large as the inflow from GMH.  

  + There is one silver lining: because the total number of patients in GMH has decreased (as more GMH patients leave to try to start in PC than PC patients start in GMH), the stress on our GMH team decreases and care quality increases. We see a ~10% decrease in the number of GMH patients with a high risk flag.  


[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_decisions.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Decisions.** *Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice?*  

  + Ask the team to decide what they want to test next.  Consider a combination of experiments 1 and 2.  Ask the team for text to type in the Decisions box.  Once they have finished, click the “Save” icon in the upper right.  
      
  **CC**: We decided to try a combination of experiments 1 and 2. We will experiment with both increasing our overall Appointment Supply in care coordination and increasing our targeted Return Visit Interval for existing patients.  
  
  **MM**: This tradeoff is not a good one for the team. Increasing referrals and reallocating appointments is not enough to serve the new OUD patients without an impact on our other patients.  
  
  **PSY**: We decided to run a third experiment. We will look to see if we can combine the effects of graduating 75% of all Completers AND increasing Initiators who Complete. We need the appointment supply that becomes available by keeping to a higher graduation rate of Completers to accommodate the higher number of Initiators who are transitioned to Completers!  
  
  **AGG**: We will continue to review additional findings.  
  
  **SP**: We have increased transitions without increasing quality. Next, let’s conduct a combined experiment, where we implement both measurement-based care and streamline stepping between GMH and PC/PCMHI.

*Don't forget to log off the simulation model!*

### That's it for *Modeling to Learn* how to compare alternatives. Next is our Done/Do review.

Today we ran experiment 2 and used the control panel of the expanded outputs section to compare the base case, experiment 1 and experiment 2. Before next time, please try to run a third experiment in your individual world.

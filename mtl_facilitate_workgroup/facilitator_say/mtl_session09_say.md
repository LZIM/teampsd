# Today we're modeling to learn how to compare alternatives.
Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to compare alternatives.  

### As you can see in the Done/Do table of the Learner See Guide:

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes you expect to observe in your experiment.
2. Test your dynamic hypothesis about your team's clinical priority.
3. Apply systems thinking to describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from your experiment.

### Let's get started:

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

## Review Past Experiment

1.  Pull up experiment 1 by logging in to the team world at mtl.how/sim.  Type in your name and password, then hit “Join Current Session.” Pull up past experiments and text by clicking on the blue “Output” header, and then the “Expand” icon in the upper middle.  Scroll down, and click on the drop down list under “Select Experiment” in the “Control Panel.”  Select your base case experiment for Alternative 1, and your previous experiment for Alternative 2.  

2.  Looking at the charts here in the Expanded Outputs section, ask “What did we learn last time?”  *If the team needs prompting, then ask them to click on the question mark that is just above the drop-down list and read out their Question, Hypothesis, Findings, and Decisions from their last experiment.*

## Run Experiment 2
[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.* 

3.  Now, ask “What new idea do we want to test this week?” Minimize the Expanded Outputs by clicking on the “box” in the upper right corner of the window, so we can see both the model and type out our Question and Hypothesis.  Ask the team for text to type into the “Question” box. The question should clearly state a directional change in at least one variable.
  -- Example for CC: Last time, we saw that changing the RVI and referral rate allowed us to start more new patients without compromising care quality. What will happen if we instead decrease the Missed Appointment % by 50% (and increase the referral rate, so we don’t run out of new patients)?


[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.*

4.	Research into experiential learning with simulation has shown that it is more impactful if the group “stakes a claim” before seeing the results of a possible future scenario.  Ask, “What do you think the effects will be of this change?  How much better will things get?”  Push the team to be as specific as possible, both with their change and the result.  Type these variables and predictions into the “Hypothesis” box.
  -- Example for CC: If we reduce the Missed Appointment % by 50% (from 22% to 11%), then we expect the new patient start rate to increase by 10%. 
  
5.	Now, ask the team why this will happen.  Reveal complexities in the model diagram to support the team telling the systems story supporting the causal relationship between their change and their expected result.  The hypotheses must track the effects of an initial change through the system, following the causal arrows in the model diagram.  
  -- Example for CC: Reducing the Missed Appointment % will cause the amount of rework to decrease, and the total number of appointments on the calendar will drop.  This will free up provider time, and allow more hours to go toward starting new patients.  This in turn will add more patients to the team, and eventually the team will fill up all the extra slots, and the start rate will balance out at a new, but higher, rate than before.  

6.	Restate the change to be tested, and move the Question and Hypothesis text to the left, in order to reveal the experiment sliders.  Move each slider named in the question to its desired value, and click  the green “Run” icon.  Name this run according to the variables you changed. To name the run, click on the down arrow next to Variable, choose the variable name you changed, for example, Appointment Supply or Return Visit Interval. Click Add. This will insert an abbreviation of that variable into the experiment name. Next, click on the down arrow next to Number, choose the number that represents the new value you used in your experiment.  Finally, click Save (not Save & Reset, just Save). The date will automatically be added to the name of the saved experiment.

## Compare Results
[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_findings.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Findings.** *Describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from this experiment.*  

7.	Now that you’ve run the scenario, ask the team what variables they should look at.  They will want to know 1) Did their experiment have the predicted result? And 2) Did their systems story in the hypothesis box explain these results?  First, expand the “Outputs” by clicking on the white box in the upper right corner.  Charts for six key variables should already be shown in the “Results Dashboard.”  If other variables are needed, then click into the drop-down under any chart to select another variable.  

8.	Ask the team for text to type into the “Findings” box, now just above the “Results Dashboard.”  These findings must be specific about both the quantitative impact of their experiment and how those results were produced.  
  -- Example for CC: Reducing the Missed Appointment % by 50% caused the Rescheduling Rate to drop from 12 appts/wk to 6, effectively opening 6 more appointments per week.  Initially, these “new slots” go mainly to new patients.  The Starting Rate to increases from 1.8 to 3.6 pts/wk, but then, as these new patients started to need return appointments, the newly-opened slots were used more and more by existing patients, so the Starting Rate dropped back to 2.2 pts/wk.  In the end, even though most of the 6 “new slots” are used by existing patients, this is a sustained 13% increase over the base case.  


[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_decisions.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Decisions.** *Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice?*  

9.	Ask the team to decide what they want to test next.  Consider a combination of experiments 1 and 2.  Ask the team for text to type in the Decisions box.  Once they have finished, click the “Save” icon in the upper right.
   + Example for CC: We will next run a combined experiment, changing both the RVI and the Missed Appointment % (and, increasing the Referral Rate, so we don’t run out of new patients).  

10.  Don't forget to log off the simulation model.

### That's it for modeling to learn how to compare alternatives. Next is our Done/Do review.

Today we ran experiment 2 and used the control panel of the expanded outputs section to compare the base case, experiment 1 and experiment 2. Before next time, please try to run a third experiment in your individual world.

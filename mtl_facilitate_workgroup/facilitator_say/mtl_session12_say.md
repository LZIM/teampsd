# Today we're modeling to learn how to turn team learning into a team plan.
Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to make future team decisions.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe what your team has learned throughout the *MTL* 12-session program.
2. Test out with each other how your new practice decisions based on systems thinking align with your team's shared vision.
3. Apply the new decisions that your team has prioritized.

# In-session Exercise: *MTL* graduation and post-*MTL* plan (30 minutes)

1. We completed _Modeling to Learn_! Let's review and plan!

2. What has the team learned throughout the *Modeling to Learn* 12-session program? 
- _MTL Co-Facilitators_ prepare a brief summary of themes to highlight with the team ____________________

3. How will we align our new practice decisions with systems thinking going forward based on our learning?

- _MTL Co-Facilitators_ prepare concise review of **causal system story of team problem** ____________________

- _MTL Co-Facilitators_ prepare concise review of **feasible practice decisions to prioritize** ____________________

4. What *MTL* resources will the team use or revisit in the future?

    - *MTL* data UI 
    
    - *MTL* sim UI (Which module would be most appropriate to our further need and questions?)

5. Lead person(s) and time frame for the above actions: _______________ 

6. Celebrate completion of *Modeling to Learn*!
   
#### MTL RESOURCES

   [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/logos/mtl_how_sim.png" height = "75" width = "110">](http://mtl.how/sim) 
      
   + The next resource is the sim UI at mtl.how/sim. Remember that you can use the sim UI in two ways. You can log in to your individual world and play on your own, or the team can explore together in the team world. Let's review the special features of each of the 5 modules and what kinds of needs they can help you think through.  

       + In Care Coordination (CC), we can compare multiple experiments and look at things like how Overwork Affects No-Shows and how we Balance New and Existing Patients.

       + In Medication Management (MM) we can experiment with team decisions across different diagnostic cohorts and how best to allocate appointments for our providers with and without x-waivers.

       + In Psychotherapy (PSY), we can look at different patterns of engagement that patients may follow. In the team data tablefor PSY, you can pull up charts to see a profile of the team's historic patient engagement pattern; and in the Outputs section you can look at the Sankey diagram to compare patient engagement patterns and the associated appointment usage for different experiments.

       + In the Aggregate (AGG) module, we can test hypotheses about our mix of services. The unique feature here is that in Outputs, we can choose to compare different experiments, as we do in all the modules; or we can compare the effects of a given experiment across the different services. 

       + Finally, the Measurement Based Stepped Care for Suicide Prevention module allows the team to conduct experiments in multiple mental health care settings, to see how decisions made in one setting impact patient care and wait times across the continuum of care.
       
   + Another resource is the library of *MTL* videos. For sessions 5 through 10, there are recordings not just for the module your team decided to use, but for all 5. The videos are available through TMS and provide continuing education credits.

   + Finally, there is a *Modeling to Learn* listserv (mtl.how@va.gov) that you can participate on; and questions for *MTL* staff can be emailed to mtl.help@va.gov. 

3. Now let's make a plan for how the team will keep modeling to learn going forward.  

   + How could you, as a clinician, or the team as a whole, see using these resources to continue quality improvement through team decision-making?
   + Is there another big question you'd like to explore through simulated experiments - either in the same module or a different one?
   + Could it be helpful to refer back the model diagram as a reminder of the systems stories it tells about decisions we make as a team?
   + Do you want to set aside some specific times - a portion of a meeting every week, or month, or quarter, say, to further explore your data and test your hypotheses?
   + How might you share these resources with new team members, and give them a dose of systems thinking?
   + Are there team members who'd like to keep up their *MTL* skills and be local *MTL* champions - coaches - remind the team of MTL when a new challenge appears on the horizon?
   + Some teams ask for a "booster" session after a few months. We're happy to facilitate that as well.
   
 13. It's great if you make a concrete action plan, identify a point person, and call on us as needed.

### Congratulations on completing *Modeling to Learn*! Here is our final Done/Do Review:

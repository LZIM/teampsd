# Today we're modeling to learn how to turn team learning into a team plan.
Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to turn team learning into a team plan.    

### As you can see in the Done/Do table of the Learner See Guide:

| We reflected on our team's vision for _MTL_ and our _MTL_ experience to prepare for planning next steps. | Celebrate our completion of _Modeling to Learn_ and make a team plan for next steps. | 

### After today's session, you will be able to:

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the range of *MTL* resources and how to find them.
2. Test out your questions and assumptions using systems thinking and *MTL* resources.
3. Apply the team's plan for future *Modeling to Learn*.

### Let's get started:

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Graduation and post-*MTL* plan

1. We completed _Modeling to Learn_! Let's celebrate! Everyone will receive a *Modeling to Learn* certificate of completion. 

2. In order to think about next steps, let's recap the *Modeling to Learn* resources, which will all remain available to you going forward.

   + First and foremost is mtl.how: your home base for links to everything *MTL*. Also visit mtl.how for updates about new releases and upgrades.

   [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/logos/mtl_how_data_sm.png" height = "75" width = "110">] (http://mtl.how/data)
      
   + Next is the data UI at mtl.how/data, which you might find useful individually in addition to as a team. If things change in the team over time and you want to update your team data for the sim UI, you can do that. The Team Lead can add new datasets to the Team World. And YOU can add new data to your Individual World. You'll use the Team Data Menu Maintenance function on the sim UI landing page, as we did in Session 5.
   
TOUR THE DATA UI

   [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/logos/mtl_how_sim.png" height = "75" width = "110">](http://mtl.how/sim) 
      
   + The next resource is the sim UI at mtl.how/sim. Remember that you can use the sim UI in two ways. You can log in to your individual world and play on your own, or the team can explore together in the team world. Let's review the special features of each of the 5 modules and what kinds of needs they can help you think through.  

       + In Care Coordination (CC), we can compare multiple experiments and look at things like how Overwork Affects No-Shows and how we Balance New and Existing Patients.

       + In Medication Management (MM) we can experiment with team decisions across different diagnostic cohorts and how best to allocate appointments for our providers with and without x-waivers.

       + In Psychotherapy (PSY), we can look at different patterns of engagement that patients may follow. In the team data tablefor PSY, you can pull up charts to see a profile of the team's historic patient engagement pattern; and in the Outputs section you can look at the Sankey diagram to compare patient engagement patterns and the associated appointment usage for different experiments.

       + In the Aggregate (AGG) module, we can test hypotheses about our mix of services. The unique feature here is that in Outputs, we can choose to compare different experiments, as we do in all the modules; or we can compare the effects of a given experiment across the different services. 

       + Finally, the Measurement Based Stepped Care for Suicide Prevention module allows the team to conduct experiments in multiple mental health care settings, to see how decisions made in one setting impact patient care and wait times across the continuum of care.
       
   + Another resource is the library of *MTL* videos. For sessions 5 through 10, there are recordings not just for the module your team decided to use, but for all 5. The videos are available through TMS and provide continuing education credits.

   + Finally, there is a *Modeling to Learn* listserv (mtl.how@va.gov) that you can participate on; and questions for *MTL* staff can be emailed to mtl.help@va.gov. 

3. Now let's make a plan for how the team will keep modeling to learn going forward.  

   + How could you, as a clinician, or the team as a whole, see using these resources to continue quality improvement through team decision-making?
   + Is there another big question you'd like to explore through simulated experiments - either in the same module or a different one?
   + Could it be helpful to refer back the model diagram as a reminder of the systems stories it tells about decisions we make as a team?
   + Do you want to set aside some specific times - a portion of a meeting every week, or month, or quarter, say, to further explore your data and test your hypotheses?
   + How might you share these resources with new team members, and give them a dose of systems thinking?
   + Are there team members who'd like to keep up their *MTL* skills and be local *MTL* champions - coaches - remind the team of MTL when a new challenge appears on the horizon?
   + Some teams ask for a "booster" session after a few months. We're happy to facilitate that as well.
   
 13. It's great if you make a concrete action plan, identify a point person, and call on us as needed.

### Congratulations on completing *Modeling to Learn*! Here is our final Done/Do Review:

# [*MTL* Live Session 12](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_live_guide/mtl_live_session12_see.Rmd "MTL Live Session 12")

# Today we're modeling to learn how to turn team learning into a team plan.
Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to turn team learning into a team plan.    

### As you can see in the Done/Do table of the Learner See Guide:

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe what your team has learned and prioritzed throughout the *MTL* 12-session program.
2. Test how your team's plan aligns with your team's shared vision.
3. Apply decisions that your team has prioritized to implement in the clinic.

### Let's get started:

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Graduation and post-*MTL* plan

1. We completed _Modeling to Learn_! Let's review and celebrate what we've learned throughout the *Modeling to Learn* 12-session program.  

   + We worked together to decide on ground rules for our work together, articulate a shared vision, and identify top team priorities.  

   + We learned how to use the _MTL_ Data UI to examine team trends over the past few years using up-to-date data from the CDW, and how to drill down to individual patients or providers.  

   + We learned how to use the _MTL_ Sim UI to tell a systems story about _____ [module] in our team.  

   + We learned how to run a Base Case simulation to see what would happen over the next two years if we made no new decisions.  

   + We learned how to to run experiments to answer questions about the effects of various team decisions - writing down our hypothesis, moving sliders to represent a test scenario, running the simulation, comparing results against the Base Case, other experiments, and expected results, and deciding how to apply the findings in our clinic.  

   + We explored our Team Need of ___ by testing what would happen if we ____ [decisions tested in exp 1, 2, 3] and we decided ____ [team decisions].  

   + Finally, we honed our systems thinking skills - recognizing complexity and feedbacks in systems and understanding system behavior as trends over time.  

2. How will we coordinate our efforts going forward based on our learning?  

   + Some teams decide to devote a portion of a team meeting each week, month, or quarter to reviewing trends in the _MTL_ Data UI;
   + Teams may also decide to delve further into their questions using the module they focused on in _MTL Live_; or 
   + They might explore questions in some of the other _MTL_ Sim UI modules. 

3. All of the *Modeling to Learn* resources will remain available to you, using your current log-in credentials. Go to mtl.how for updates and reminders on how to access them. You can continue to use:

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/logos/mtl_how_data_sm.png" height = "75" width = "110">] (http://mtl.how/data)
   + mtl.how/data - Your Team Lead can create an updated or different dataset for use in the Sim UI at any time. And all team members can explore their own and the team's trends.  

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/logos/mtl_how_sim.png" height = "75" width = "110">](http://mtl.how/sim) 
   + mtl.how/sim - both your individual and team worlds.  

   + _MTL Video_ recordings for the 12 sessions you completed, as well as for Sessions 5 through 10 in each of the other modules, are available through TMS or (without CEU credit) for watching anytime at mtl.how/video.  
   
   + _MTL_ headquarters and facilitators are available via _____ [how will they request help?] to trouble-shoot technical issues or answer questions.  

   + And _MTL_ facilitators are happy to schedule a "booster" with the team in a few months if you would like.  


4. What does the team plan to do going forward? What is the time frame and who will be the point person for this plan?

5. Learners who finish all 12 *Modeling to Learn* sessions will receive a certificate of completion. 


### Congratulations on completing *Modeling to Learn*! Here is our final Done/Do Review:

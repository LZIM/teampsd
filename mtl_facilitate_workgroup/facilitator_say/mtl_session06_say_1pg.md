# [MTL Live Session 06](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_live_guide/mtl_live_session06_see.Rmd "MTL Live Session 06")

## Today we're modeling to learn how to tell a systems story.
- [ ]  Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to tell a systems story.

## Navigate to SEE guide to show Done and Do
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Recommended time 00:00-00:10 minutes** 
- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">  Done: We logged in to mtl.how/sim and reviewed the "i" information in the Model Diagram and Experiments section.
- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "45" width = "45"> Do: We will tell a systems story about the team's top priority of _______________________________ using the Model Diagram in the sim UI.

## Show the Learning Objectives on the Screen - TEAM PRIORITIES to EMPHASIZE ____________________________________________________
- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/learning_objectives.png" height = "45" width = "45"> Learning Objectives for Session 6
1. Describe the systems story of your team's highest priority. 
2. Test out your thinking about causes of team challenges using the model diagram.
3. Apply clinical expertise to develop a question for team learning using simulation.

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Recommended time 00:10-00:15 minutes** 

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes) TEAM PRIORITIES to EMPHASIZE ____________________________________________________
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Recommended time 00:10-00:15 minutes** 
- [ ] <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png" height = "50" width = "150"> Provide rationale for building capacity for participatory learning from simulation
- [ ] A Systems Story is a description of the causal connections that create the problem your team prioritized, _________________ .  

## Team lead shares Chrome and logs in to your Individual world at **mtl.how/sim**
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Recommended time 00:15-00:20 minutes** 
- [ ] **Re-size** your screen to get more or less of the diagram
- [ ] Select to continue with the **same module** 
- [ ] Navigate to the **experiment section** to pull up the **question** from last time.

## Introducing the Main Section with the Model Diagram - TEAM PRIORITIES to EMPHASIZE ____________________________________________________
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Recommended time 00:20-00:30**  
- [ ] **Experiment Timeline** Over what time frame does an experiment run? Two years from today.
- [ ] **Blue circle "i"** are calculated by simulation user interface from the red variables that are read in from team data. 
- [ ] **Reveal complexity** shows more of the model diagram being shown but the model still accounts for all the complexity.
- [ ] **Red variables** are red in from team data.

## Telling a Causal Systems Story - TEAM VARIABLES/SPECIFIC VALUES to EMPHASIZE ____________________________________________________
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Recommended time 00:30-00:40**  
- [ ] The navy blue circles or gauges are always a **rate per week.** 
- [ ] The navy blue rectangles are **stocks** or states where patients or appointments accumulate.
- [ ] **Close the feedback loop** Trace the loop all the way around until we are back where we started.
- [ ] **Use Thumbs + plus** means two variables move in the same direction (both up/both down)-TEAM VARIABLES to EMPHASIZE ____________________________________________________
- [ ] **Use Thumbs - minus** means two variables move in opposite directions (1 thumb up, 1 thumb down)- TEAM PRIORITIES to EMPHASIZE ____________________________________________________

## Telling a Causal Systems Story - TEAM CAUSAL LOOP to EMPHASIZE ____________________________________________________
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Recommended time 00:40-00:50**  
- [ ] Cover the **basecase values** in the complexity reveal (causal loop) most releveant to the team's highest priority need.
- [ ] As you tell the story, **ENTER TEXT** about **dynamic hypothesis** What do you expect will happen over the next two years if the team continues with business as usual? 
- [ ] **Save** the text.

## Have Team Lead pull up the sesison 06 Done/Do review.
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Recommended time 00:50-00:55**  
- [ ] Log into your individual world and enter a Question and Hypothesis about the base case experimental run in the Text section.
- [ ] Log out  out of the SIM UI! 
- [ ] Team post session 06 email will be sent.

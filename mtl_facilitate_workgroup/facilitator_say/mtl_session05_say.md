Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ and today we're modeling to learn how to log in to our team world.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the team data in the Experiments tile.
2. Test out the simulation user-interface for more information about team data.
3. Apply clinical expertise to consider the decisions the team makes that affect these variables.

### Let's get started:

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

1. Check the name of your team data file in Internet Explorer. In session 3, we used our team data UI and clicked “Get Team Data Table for Sim UI” to produce our team data for simulation. Let’s now go back to mtl.how/data in an Internet Explorer window to check the name of our team data file. The team data file for simulation is in our team folder, in the team_data_sim folder.

2.	Log in to the sim UI, which works best in a Chrome browser. Open a new browser window and go to mtl.how/SIM. Enter your username and password and click the green Login button. You’ll see a section with a drop-down menu that says Please select a World. Click the down-arrow to see the choices, and choose the team world. 

3.	Orient yourself to the landing page

a.	 At the top left is the MTL logo. That’s on every page in the sim and works as a Home button (there’s also a button labelled Home).

b.	Reading across on that row you see your Team name followed by five navigation icons. I call your attention to the Logoff button. It’s best practice to always log off when you’re finished using the sim.
  
c.	On the right is your name and picture – if you’ve uploaded it to your profile. (Add link to instructions for setting Gravatar.)
  
d.	Under that row is some welcome text, followed by 3 sections with blue headers: Session, Experiment Maintenance, and Team Data Menu Maintenance. Headers with a white triangle on the right can be expanded and collapsed. 
  
e.	Note that users who are not designated as TeamLead will not see all of these features. We’ll describe the functionality of the different roles later. But each of you IS the “TeamLead” for your individual world, so you’ll see all of this when you log in there.
  
f.	The two right-hand sections are, as they say, for maintenance – one allows you to see, rename, and delete past experiments the team has run; the other allows you to upload, select, and remove Team Data sets that will populate the model. 
  
g.	Go to the section on the left, and you’ll see that you have two main choices: You can Join the Current Session or Start a New Session. If there IS a “current session”, there will be information underneath that heading that shows which module (CC, MM, etc.) and which team data set is loaded for the session. Today there’s nothing there because you haven’t started a session. In future, you’ll almost always just join the current session because you’ll want to continue working with the same module and dataset.
  
h.	Since there’s no current session, we will start a new one. Based on our discussion last time, we determined that the module that makes most sense for this team to work in first is __________. This module will let you explore your questions about __________ and ___________. So, select _______ , and you’ll see another request pop up to Select Team Data. Click on that and the down-arrow for the drop-down menu – and there is nothing there. This is the Team Data Menu that the far right section, Team Data Menu Maintenance, is referring to.

4.	So now let’s go to that section and expand it. We want to Add the data file that you created before, so click Add. Since you need to enter the filename EXACTLY as it is named in the data UI folder, the best thing is to copy and paste it in here. So go to your Explorer window, grab that name, and come back here to paste it into the space. Pay attention to make sure it didn’t get truncated in the translation. Click Save and Voila: It’s now there! 

a.	Other functions in this section are you can Sort the data file list either alphabetically or by date by clicking the column header. You can delete a file by selecting the checkbox and hitting delete. And you can correct a file name to exactly match the one you're trying to load by selecting and Renaming it. (You can not change the name to something different or it won't bring in the data file you need anymore.)

5.	Now let’s go back over to the Session section and click the Select Team Data button. Choose the data file you just uploaded and click Get File, and then click PLAY.

6.	Look over the Main Page of the SimUI

a.	You see the same information and buttons across the top; and you see a new set of sections with blue headers. 

b.	The section on the left names the module and team data you selected in the header bar. It contains an Experiment Timeline section and the model diagram for the ______ module.

c.	On the right you see an Outputs section, an Experiments section, and a Text section.

7.	The Text section is here so you can record your thinking – you questions, hypotheses, what you did, what you learned, what you decided – to keep track of it so that when you come back you can easily remember and pick up where you left off. So let’s start by jotting some notes in the first box. You might type – We loaded our team data table into the sim UI and now we’re exploring the Team Data Table. You could also type these questions that I’m going to ask you:

a.	Where did the data in this table come from?
  
b.	What are the variables in the table?
  
c.	What are the units for the different variables?
  
d.	Do the values line up with how you think things really are?
  
e.	What types of decisions does the team make that affect these variables?
  
8.	Now let’s discuss the questions you typed into the Text box. TeamLead, you can type the answers into the Hypothesis or Findings box depending on which you think they are. If there are questions that need to be researched further, you can type those in the Questions box.

9.	Click on the “i” next to the name, Team Data Table. This opens a section with details on how the numbers in this table were calculated from the team data you selected and uploaded. There are “i” buttons throughout the sim UI to help you quickly answer your questions about meanings, calculations, units, etc.

10. When you're done in the sim UI, it's always best to log off. Click Logoff at the top right, then click it again to confirm.

### That's it for modeling to learn how to log in to our team world. Next is our Done/Do review.

### DO Demo

1. For next time, if you can, log in to to the sim UI at mtl.how/sim. 

2. Remember that when you first enter your log-in credentials, you'll be able to choose between your Team world and your Individual world. If you choose your Team world, it will already have a "session" started - because we did that today when we chose the module and selected the team data file that we had added. So you will choose Join Current Session and click Play.

3. If you're ambitious to dig in and "play" in the sim, you can choose your Individual world and add the team data to the team data menu the same way we did just now. Then you can choose the module, select the data, and click Play. You can explore to your heart's content in your Individual world without worrying that you'll "break" anything or change anything for the rest of your team.

4. Whichever way you get to hitting Play from the Sim UI landing page, it will take you to the main page for the module. We encourage you to explore the interface more. 

5. In particular, check out the “i” information available throughout the sim UI - in the Experiments section and in the model diagram - to prepare for our next session. 

## Until next time, thanks for "Modeling to Learn"!

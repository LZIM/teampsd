Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ and today we're modeling to learn how to log in to our team world.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the team data in the Experiments tile.
2. Test out the simulation user-interface for more information about team data.
3. Apply clinical expertise to consider the decisions the team makes that affect these variables.

## Participatory Learning from Simulation

a) In Sessions 2 and 3 we used the data UI to look back at team trends over the past two years. That gave us a sense of *what is* in our team now.  

b) Backward looking data review is limited for guiding effective change. Even when we see a trend we like, we may not know what is causing it, and we may worry that the next change we make will undo it.  

c) It's also really demotivating to see trends we don't like and not know what's causing the problem.   

d) Today we're at a turning point where we will begin to use the simulation UI to anticipate future trends.  

e) We'll start asking *what if* questions about different decisions the team could make.   

f) With the sim UI we have a way to test our hypotheses about those questions that lets us learn "as quick as we learn not to touch a hot stove".   

g) And even more importantly, this virtual world lets us test our "what if" questions without any risk to the lives of veterans.   

h) Simulation helps us to place a better initial bet about what is likely to pay off for our local Veteran community in terms of getting patients timely access to our highest quality care.

### Let's get started:

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Log in; upload and review team data

**1. In session 3, we used the *MTL* data UI at mtl.how/data to produce our team data file for use in simulation. 

**2. We want to locate that file now because the first thing we will do when we open the SIM UI is to load that data file we created. 

**3. Using Internet Explorer, go to mtl.how/data. The team data file for simulation is in the team folder named team_data_sim. 

**4. Now, leave that browser window as it is - we'll come back to it in a minute - and open a new window for the sim UI. This works best in Chrome.

a) Go to mtl.how/sim, enter your username and password, and click the green Login button.   

b) When you're asked to Select a World, click the down-arrow to open the drop-down menu and see the choices.   

c) When we're working together, we'll be in the Team world.   

d) Each team member also has their own individual world you can play in as much as you want - there's nothing you can "break" and no veterans will be harmed as you experiment virtually. But for team sessions we'll use the team world.   

e) Be aware that this is a responsive web design, meaning that it adjusts the page layout to optimize to your screen's dimensions. For example, if you use your browser control to reduce the window size, the sim UI will adjust to stack these sections vertically instead of showing them side by side. Similarly, if you are logged in on a smartphone or other device, it might look different to you.  


**5. Let's orient ourselves to what's on the landing page:

a) At the top left is the *MTL* logo. That’s on every page in the sim UI, and it works as a Home button (just like the button next to it), bringing you back to this landing page.

b) Reading across on that row you see your Team name followed by five navigation icons: Home, Play, Chat, Help, and Logoff. These are pretty self-explanatory, but I want to highlight the Logoff button and mention that it's always best to log off when you’re finished with a session in the sim UI. At the far right along the top is your picture (if you’ve uploaded it) and your name.
   
c) Below that row is the *MTL* welcome text, and under that there are 3 sections headings in blue bars: Session; Experiment Maintenance; and Team Data Menu Maintenance. Whenever you see blue bars like these with a white triangle on the right, that means those sections can be expanded and collapsed by clicking on the bar.
  
d) If you're not designated as TeamLead, you won't see all of these features. But everyone is designated “TeamLead” for their individual world and will see everything when you're logged in there.
  

**6. Now we'll Start a New Session.   

a) In the section on the left, you see two main choices: Join the Current Session or Start a New Session. Since this is the first time we've logged in to this world, there is no “current session”. After this, there will be, and details about it will show up underneath the Join Current Session option. For today, we will start a new session.   

b) Based on the team's needs we discussed last time, we decided to use the _________ module for experiments in the sim UI. If we choose that, a dialog pops up to Select Team Data.   

c) Click on Select Team Data, then click the down-arrow for the drop-down menu. The menu is empty because we have not uploaded the team's data file yet.   

d) This dropdown list is the Team Data Menu, which is managed by the far right section on the screen, Team Data Menu Maintenance. Go to that section and click the blue bar to expand it.  

e) There are 3 options under the blue bar: Delete, Rename, and Add. We want to Add your team data file to the menu we just saw, so we select Add.   

f) It's important to enter the filename EXACTLY as it is named in the team_data_sim folder, so the best thing is to copy and paste it in here.   

g) Go to the browser window showing the team data folder, grab the name of the team data file (Control C), and paste it into the Add or Change Filename text box (Control V). Make sure it didn’t get cut off and that it has the Excel extension; that is, the filename ends in .xlsx.   

h) If you need to make a correction, you can click the check-box by it and use the Rename function. But we should have the correct file name there, so we click Save and Voila! Our team data file will now be available for us in the Choose Team Data menu!  

i) Just to finish reviewing this screen before we move on, let's click the blue bar of the middle section to expand it. As the title says, this section is for maintaining experiments we've run. We can delete, rename, or export them from here. Since we haven't run any experiments yet, this section is still empty; but it won't be for long!  

j) Now let’s go back to the section on the far left, choose Start a New Session in the _______ module; click Select Team Data, open the drop-down menu, and choose the data file we just uploaded. Click Get File, and then click PLAY.   

k) The very first time we use a given team data file, you may notice a short delay as the sim reads in the data. After that, it should open up the sim UI Main Page pretty quickly.  


**7.	Let's explore the Main Page of the SimUI:

a) It has the same information and buttons across the top as on the landing page; and there's a new set of sections with blue headers.  

b) The blue bar of the large section on the left names the module and team data file we selected, and in that section is the model diagram for the _________ module, with an Experiment Timeline section at the top.  

c) To the right of the main section are 3 blue bars labelled Outputs, Experiments, and Text. The Text section can be moved around by placing the cursor over the blue bar and dragging. It can also be expanded, shrunk, or closed by clicking the icons on the right side of the blue bar: the open square/double square, or the circle with an X. Expanding it opens up the Outputs section, including the Text boxes. Reduce it back to Text-only the same way you expanded it. If you minimize it with the X, you can get it back by going to the Output section and selecting Expand.  

**8. The next thing we want to do is to explore the Team Data Table, which is in the upper part of the Experiments Section. Let's move the Text over and expand Experiments.

a) The data in this table come from - you guessed it, the team data file. In fact, throughout the sim UI, we've used the convention that red font means "read in from team data".  

![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/red_slider_experiment.png)

   
b) To see how the values in this table were calculated from team data, click on the round "i" icon in the top left corner of the Team Data Table. This symbol is used throughout the sim UI to show where you can get more information.  

![](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/information.png) = INFORMATION

**9. Let's review the variables in the table and their units.
   
CARE COORDINATION MODULE Team Data Table


MEDICATION MANAGEMENT MODULE Team Data Table


PSYCHOTHERAPY MODULE Team Data Table


AGGREGATE MODULE Team Data Table


SUICIDE PREVENTION MODULE Team Data Table

   + Think about how the values in the table line up with how you think things really are in your team. There may be differences, for example, if things have changed a lot over the past few months. Just keep those thoughts in mind, because you can experiment with different values over the next few sessions. 
  
   + Also think about what types of decisions the team has within its control that affect these variables. The variables may suggest some of the kinds of decisions front-line staff can explore for optimizing care for veterans in ways that work for staff.

10. Before we close the browser window, let's log out of the sim UI. It's best practice to do that any time you need to turn off or leave your computer for a while.


### That's it for _Modeling to Learn_ how to log in to our team world. Since we're finished with this session, we'll LOGOFF of the Sim UI. Next is our Done/Do review.

### DO demo

1. For next time, if you can, log in to to the sim UI at mtl.how/sim. 

2. Remember that when you first enter your log-in credentials, you'll be able to choose between your Team world and your Individual world. If you choose your Team world, it will already have a "session" started - because we did that today when we chose the module and selected the team data file that we had added. So you will choose Join Current Session and click Play.

3. If you're ambitious to dig in and "play" in the sim, you can choose your Individual world and add the team data to the team data menu the same way we did just now. Then you can choose the module, select the data, and click Play. You can explore to your heart's content in your Individual world without worrying that you'll "break" anything or change anything for the rest of your team.

4. Whichever way you get to hitting Play from the Sim UI landing page, it will take you to the main page for the module. We encourage you to explore the interface more. 

5. In particular, check out the “i” information available throughout the sim UI - in the Experiments section and in the model diagram - to prepare for our next session. 

## Until next time, thank you for _Modeling to Learn_!

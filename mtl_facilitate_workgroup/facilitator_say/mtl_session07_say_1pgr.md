# [MTL Live Session 07](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_live_guide/mtl_live_session06_see.Rmd "MTL Live Session 06")

## Today we're modeling to learn how to evaluate our Base Case of no new decisions.
- [ ]  Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________. Today we're modeling to learn how to evaluate our Base Case of no new decisions.

## Navigate to the SEE guide to show Done and Do
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:00-00:10** 
- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/done.png" height = "40" width = "40">  Done: We logged in to our individual world at mtl.how/sim. We entered in our own hypothesis about the Base Case in the Text section.
- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/do.png" height = "45" width = "45"> Do: We will run a "BC" simulation and review the impact of making no new decision on ________________ in the MTL sim UI Outputs section.

## Emphasize team priority with the learning objectives on the screen 
- [ ] <img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/learning_objectives.png" height = "45" width = "45"> **Learning Objectives for Session 7**
1. Describe the base case of no new decisions in your team. 
2. Test out your thinking about what is likely to cause oscillation in team trends. 
3. Apply systems thinking to develop a hypothesis about your team's clinical priority. 

## Start in-session exercise and provide rationale for running a base case with no new decisions. 
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:10-00:15 - Team-specific rationale** __________________
- [ ] <img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/illustrations/data_ui_sim_ui.png" height = "50" width = "150"> Provide rationale for preparing for running a base case of no new decisions prior to running simulation experiments.
- [ ] The first step in learning from simulation is to run a base case simulation against which all future experiments will be compared.   

## Team lead shares Chrome and logs in to the Team world at **mtl.how/sim**
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:15-00:20 - Team's Session 06 Question** __________________
- [ ] Join current session to pick up where the team left off in Session 06.
- [ ] Orient to main page: Team name, module, and selected data file.
- [ ] Navigate to the team's Session 06 question.

## Creating a Base Case question and hypothesis related to our team making no new decisions
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:20-00:30 - Team Priority**__________________ 
- [ ] Provide rationale for creating a team question and hypothesis related to a BC with no new decisions. 
- [ ] Example question: What happens to ____________ (from the team's priority) if we make no new decisions? 
- [ ] Example hypothesis: Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe (AGG, CC, MM, PSY, or SP)
- [ ] Input our team's BC question and hypothesis into the Text box.
- [ ] Continue to describe the causal loop most relevant to the team's highest priority need. 

## Running the Base Case of no new decisions
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:30-00:40  - Team Priority**__________________
- [ ] Set all experiment sliders to "bc" or "zero" except purple sliders, which start with a default value of "1".
- [ ] Hit "Run"!
- [ ] Go to the Expanded Outputs section and **Save** (without resetting) our run. 

## Practice describing specific output charts related to the team's highest priority need using Base Case data
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:40-00:50 - Team Priority**__________________
- [ ] Look at the results with the team specific to the team's question and hypothesis for the BC run.
- [ ] What does the team notice about the results related to their highest priority need? 
- [ ] Describe team findings in the *Our Findings* textbox, and explain how the findings relate to the team's question and hypothesis. 
- [ ] Based on what the team learned in this base case experiment, what does the team want to try next? 
- [ ] Record next steps in the *Our Decisions* textbox to help guide future experiements. 

## Have Team Lead pull up the session 06 SEE guide Done/Do review.
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> _____________ **Time 00:50-00:55**  
- [ ] Done: We entered our Question, Hypothesis, Findings and Decision for our Base Case (bc) in the Text section.
- [ ] Do: Log into mtl.how/sim and explore the results of the BC run in the Results Dashboard of the Expanded Outputs section to prepare for experiment 1. 
- [ ] Demo for team how to reload team's prior Question, Hypothesis, Findings and Decision. 
- [ ] Reminder to click "Save" and log out.

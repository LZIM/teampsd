# Today we're modeling to learn how to prioritize team needs.

Hello! [Co-facilitators introduce themselves] Today we're modeling to learn how to prioritize team needs.

# Done
MTL Session 3 focused on how to produce team data for simulation using the data user interface. Who remembers what the web address is for the data UI? [mtl.how/data]

Last session, we explored a team data table that featured team trends over two years. We examined how the team data was estimated and reviewed the descriptions and definitions for the data in the various tabs. Finally, the team was asked to call on their clinical expertise to analyze the team data and team trends to identify team priorities for future learning. You were asked to complete two tasks: find something in the team data table and to answer the questions at mtl.how/menu.  
+	What data in the team data was of greatest interest as you explored mtl.how/data?  
+	Are there any questions about the data UI? *For Video: If you have questions about the data UI at any time during this module, please contact Team PSD at..."

# Do
MTL.how/menu was created to help teams identify priorities for action in clinical care. Today we will focus on prioritizing team needs.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the high priority needs reported across the team.
2. Test out how these needs are experienced across the team through team dialogue.
3. Consider the team vision and apply team decision-making to select a high-priority module of *MTL*.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

1. Complete the [*MTL* Menu](https://mtl.how/menu) on your own.  

+ The purpose of the Menu is help identify team needs. You received an email this week reminding you to complete the questions on mtl.how/menu. Did everyone complete the questions at mtl.how/menu?  

+ If no team members have completed the questions on mtl.how/menu, guide the team members to the website to complete the questions.  

+ **For *MTL* Video - Ideally all members of a team would complete the MTL Menu. With everyone's input we then explore what clinical care issues are most important to a clinic team. For this lesson, we will assume you are part of a team that has completed MTL Menu. Let's review your team's results.** 

2. Review the team's results in your team. 
+ Thank you for completing the mtl.how/menu.  
+ *INSERT IMAGE OF MTL.HOW/MENU RESULTS EXAMPLE*  
+ Our first step is to scan through the team’s results. Look for two or three items that stand out to you in the responses.  

   + *Facilitator Action*
   •	Lead discussion of what stood out to the team members as they scanned the responses.  
   •	Take notes as team members reveal what stood out to them.  

+ We see that the majority of your team considers INSERT TEXT an important issue. Also, it appears that there is a wide array of responses for INSERT TOPIC.

3. Look for areas of consensus among the team.  
•	Where do you see high areas of consensus? What issues does the team agree about?  
•	The team agrees that INSERT TEXT and INSERT TEXT are important as evidenced by the high percent of team members that selected those items.

   + *Facilitator Action*  
   •	Lead discussion on areas of consensus or agreement among the team.  
   •	Take notes as team member reveal the areas where team responses are showing consensus.  


4. Discuss items in which team members varied a lot in their rankings.  
•	Where does the team have more variable perspectives?  
•	We want to find those responses where there is a lot of variability or a wide spread in the responses on specific priorities. In the team example, we see a wide array of responses for INSERT TOPIC as mentioned previously as well as INSERT TOPIC and INSERT TOPIC.

   + *Facilitator Action*  
   •	Lead discussion on areas of variability across the team.  


5. Focus on the high priority needs to select a module for sessions 5-10 of Modeling to Learn 

+ What is the highest priority need for your team now? If we go back and scan the *MTL* Menu results, it appears that INSERT TEXT and INSERT TEXT are important to everyone.
•	This is a critical step as the highest priority needs will drive which Modeling to Learn module is selected for *MTL* sessions 5 through 10. 

+ The MTL modules that are available for your team to use are:
  •	Care Coordination (CC)  
  •	Medication Management (MM)  
  •	Psychotherapy (PSY)  
  •	Aggregrate team services (AGG)  
  •	Measurement-based stepped care for suicide prevention  

+ Given all that has been discussed today in the Menu results, what are the high priority needs for your team?  

   + *Facilitator Action*  
   •	Lead discussion to identify highest priority need for the team.  
   •	Take notes to as team determines their highest priority need.  
   •	Reflect back the team discussion and suggest which need you heard as the team’s highest priority need.  
   •	Facilitate the team to reach consensus on which MTL module will best allow them to explore their highest priority need.  

+ Based on the team's input, we have decided that your team's highest priority is INSERT TEXT and the *MTL* module that would best help your team explore actions around this priority is INSERT MODULE NAME.

# Today we're modeling to learn how to prioritize team needs.

Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ , and today we're modeling to learn how to prioritize team needs.  

### As we see in the Done/Do table of the Learner See Guide:

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the high priority needs reported across the team.
2. Test out how these needs are experienced across the team through team dialogue.
3. Consider the team vision and apply team decision-making to select a high-priority module of *MTL*.

### Let's get started:

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Menu results and team needs discussion


Time Stamp | Prioritize tailored team learning | Edit SAY guide and practice
-- | -- | --
<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> 00:10-00:15 | **Cue** up the "throughline" between the team's learning vision, team data and team need question 6 from the Post-Session debrief.

### 1. Complete the *MTL Menu* on your own.
  a. Everyone on the team has completed the MTL Menu, and we are showing the tabulated results *[Show Menu Results]*. 
  b. You will receive a summary of this in your follow-up email. 

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> 00:15-00:20 | **Review** to identify the themes from the team vision that should be highlighted in the team data. | **Decide which charts you need to review to choose between your top two module choices and bring the team to concensus on the module.**

### 2. Review the team's results with your team
  a. First we'll scan through the results and see what stands out. We talked about ___________ last session, so let's look at ___________ chart first. The left side of each chart is the high priority, and the right side is low priority.  *[Lead discussion; take notes.]*  

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> 00:20-00:25 | **Plan** reflections for team responses to the prompt questions that relate to the team's vision. | **2. In the SAY guide, fill in the specific values in the Team Data table (sessions 2 and 3) that reveal the team's highest priority need.**

### 3. Look for areas of consensus among the team.  

  a. Where are there areas of high consensus? What issues does the team agree about?  When I hear ___________ , it makes me think of __________ module. 
  
### 4. Discuss items in which team members varied a lot in their rankings.  

  a. What the topics where team members' perspectives are more divergent?  



### 5. Focus on the high priority needs to select a module.  

a. Let's think about what looks like the highest priority need for the team right now and which _Modeling to Learn_ module best addresses that need. *[Recap the highest priority need, recommended module, and why.]*  
  b. There are currently 5 _MTL_ modules available for teams to focus on in sessions 5 through 10:  
  Three modules focus on how a team provides a specific service -- care coordination, medication management, or psychotherapy; one module addresses issues balancing patients' needs and provider time across services; and one explores issues related to patients' symptoms and risk, along with referrals to and from the team to other settings.
  We will use this module to explore "what-if" scenarios, to use the data we've been exploring to help us learn what improvement ideas will work better than others for our team.


<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> 00:40-00:50 | **Reflect** with your co-facilitator double-check your thinking about the team's relative consensus about their priorities _before_ going to the MTL menu in session 4. | **4. Describe the relevant features of the choosen module, touching on a) multiple team member's points of view, b) multiple variables that are related to one another (e.g., RVI and engagement duration), c) multiple problems that are likely related, and c) the "throughline" across learning sessions.** 

**Examples below:** 
  + Care Coordination (CC)  
  + Medication Management (MM)  
  + Psychotherapy (PSY)  
  + Aggregrate team services (AGG)  
  + Measurement-based stepped care for suicide prevention (SP)  
  
 + CC shows how a variety of team decisions interact to impact multiple outcomes at the same time. You can explore trade-offs between decisions such as desired new patient wait times, current patient return visit intervals, and overbooking and how they affect team outcomes like total missed appointments, number of patients in care, and number of patients completing care.

 + MM enables you to experiment with how team decisions about referrals, time allocation and visit frequency impact the quality of medication management for patients. Your team can explore scenarios to balance these tradeoffs and better meet the specific needs of patients with depression, alcohol use disorder and opioid use disorder. Insights you gain can help you increase local reach of evidence-based pharmacotherapies. 

 + PSY shows how team psychotherapy decisions interact, and depicts patterns of psychotherapy engagement in your team. You can explore solutions to the challenges of getting patients to complete a full course of therapy, while also achieving goals to start enough new patients in psychotherapy. Insights about these dynamics can be used to increase the local reach of evidence-based psychotherapies. 

 + AGG shows how a variety of team decisions interact to impact multiple outcomes at the same time. You can explore trade-offs between decisions such as desired new patient wait times, current patient return visit intervals, and overbooking and how they affect team outcomes like total missed appointments, number of patients in care, and number of patients completing care. 

 + SP shows the effects of measurement based stepped care on patients' symptoms and risk. It allows you to explore the impacts of implementing measurement based care to reduce delays in detecting patients at high risk for suicide, and to improve the quality of care by making better team decisions about when to step patients up to a higher level of care, or step them down to a lower level of care. It is also possible to experiment with team decisions related to new patient wait-times and access, the use of community care, and the impacts of provider overwork and burnout on the quality of care.

### That's it for _Modeling to learn_ how to prioritize team needs. Next is our Done/Do review.

## Done and Do (15 minutes)
<!-- Do/Done Tables -->

### DO demo

<img src = "https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/icons/timestamp.png" height = "40" width = "40" style ="display: inline-block"/> 00:50-00:60 | **Success** - A successful Done/Do Review is short, specific, simple and shown.

1. For the next 5 sessions, we will use the _Modeling to Learn_ Simulation User Interface, or sim UI.

2. Remember, all the _MTL_ resources can be accessed from your home base at mtl.how if you forget a specific link. But to go directly to the log-in page for the sim UI, just type mtl.how/sim into your browser.

3. Unlike the data UI, which requires us to use the VA's default browser, Internet Explorer, this UI works better with Chrome. We recommend you use that.

4. The sim UI is designed for use with a variety of devices, from large-monitor desktops to tablets and smartphones. The view adjusts for different sizes and aspect ratios so you may notice some slight variations in how it looks, but the basic functionality is the same on all of them.

5. To log in to the sim UI, you will need your username and password. Once you enter your credentials, you'll be asked to select a World, and you'll see 2 options in the drop-down menu: a team world and an individual world. We'll describe these more next time. For now you should choose the one that starts with IND for individual. Click Log In, and check out the *MTL* sim UI landing page. 

7. You won't be able to go further than that yet, but feel free to look around at what's on that page.


## Until next time, thank you for *Modeling to Learn*!

# Today we're modeling to learn how to prioritize team needs.

Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ , and today we're modeling to learn how to prioritize team needs.  

### Looking at the Done/Do table, we see that in preparation for this session...

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the high priority needs reported across the team.
2. Test out how these needs are experienced across the team through team dialogue.
3. Consider the team vision and apply team decision-making to select a high-priority module of *MTL*.

### Let's get started.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

### 1. Everyone on the team has completed the MTL Menu, and we are showing the tabulated results *[Show Menu Results]*. You will receive a summary of this in your follow-up email. 

### 2. First we'll scan through the results and see what stands out. *[Lead discussion; take notes.]*  

a. Where are there areas of high consensus? What issues does the team agree about?
  
b. What the topics where team members' perspectives are more divergent?  

### 3. What looks like the highest priority need for your team now, and which _Modeling to Learn_ module best addresses that need?

a. There are currently 5 _MTL_ modules available for teams to focus on in sessions 5 through 10:

  •	Care Coordination (CC)  
  •	Medication Management (MM)  
  •	Psychotherapy (PSY)  
  •	Aggregrate team services (AGG)  
  •	Measurement-based stepped care for suicide prevention (SP)

b. *[Recap the highest priority need, recommended module, and why.]*

### That's it for modeling to learn how to prioritize team needs. Next is our Done/Do review.

### DO demonstration

1. For the next 5 sessions, we will use the _Modeling to Learn_ Simulation User Interface, or sim UI.

2. Remember, all the _MTL_ resources can be linked to from your home base at mtl.how, if you forget the specific link. But to go directly to the log-in page for the sim UI, just type mtl.how/sim into your browser.

3. Unlike the data UI, for which we used the VA's default browser, Internet Explorer, this UI works better with Chrome. We recommend you use that.

4. The sim UI is designed for use with a variety of hardware, including large-monitor desktop computers, smaller laptop computers, notebooks, and smart phones. The view adjusts for different sizes and aspect ratios, so you may notice some slight variations in how it looks on different devices. The basic functionality is the same on all of them, though.

5. To log in to the sim UI, you will need your username and password. The username is just your VA email address, and your password will be sent to you in the follow-up email after the session.

6. Once you enter your username and password, you'll be asked to select a World. You will have two options, a team world and an individual world. We'll describe these more next time. If you go in before next session, you can choose either one.

7. This will get you to the sim UI home page. You won't be able to go further than that yet. But feel free to study what you see on that page.


## Until next time, thank you for *Modeling to Learn*!

## Done and Do

Last session we uploaded the team data file and logged in to mtl.how/sim. We chose the _____ module to work in and we checked out the main page of the sim UI, especially focusing on the Team Data Table in the Experiments section. We started recording questions and more in the Text section.

Were you able to log in to your individual world and look at the “i” information in the Model Diagram and Experiments section? What did you find? Do you have any questions?

Today we will tell a systems story about the team’s top priority using the Model Diagram in the sim UI.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the systems story of your team's highest priority. 
2. Test out your thinking about causes of team challenges using the model diagram.
3. Apply clinical expertise to develop a question for team learning using simulation.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes): The Model Diagram and Systems Story

1.	Log in to your individual world at mtl.how/sim, selecting the _____ module. Let us know when you are in the sim.

2.	We will give you a series of questions in the Adobe Connect chat box and aloud over audio. Your job is to find the answer in the Model Diagram and chat it back to us in the  Adobe Connect chat box. If you’re stuck, you can ask for help via a private chat with the facilitators, and we’ll give a verbal and chat hint to all participants.

a.	Question 1: Over what timeframe does an experiment “run?”

b.	Question 2: Where can you find descriptions for the variables in the Model Diagram?

c.	Paste a part of a description from something that is a Rate into the chat box.

d.	Question 3: Describe in one sentence what happens in the diagram when you “Reveal Complexity?”

e.	Question 4: What are the units of time in the sim?”

3.	Now we’ll use the Model Diagram to tell a systems story about the needs and questions the team identified as your priority. (How to create scripts for this for all the modules and various priorities?) As we do this, we’ll try to zero in on a specific question or questions that you’d like to explore through simulation experiments. My co-facilitator will try to capture those in the Question text box so we don’t lose track.  Facilitator leads discussion, using mouse to trace on Model Diagram, eliciting more clinical perspective from the team to pin down their question(s).

Tip re: viewing a larger part of the Model Diagram at once. If you are looking at the sim UI in a full browser screen, you might not be able to see the whole Model Diagram at once. If you click the layered boxes in the upper right of your browser (between minimize and close), you’ll be able to resize the browser window, and the sim UI will adjust to fit various aspect ratios. You can find the view that works best for you.


[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.* 

## Done and Do

We told a systems story about our team’s top priority and began recording our questions in the Text section.

Next time, we’ll run our first simulation – the Base Case of no new decisions. Before next time, we’d like you to log in to your individual world at mtl.how/sim and type your question and hypothesis about the Base Case into the Text section. The question is really just, “What will clinic care look like over the next two years if we make no new decisions?” Give some thought to what you expect and write a sentence or two describing your hypothesis to prepare for our running that simulation next time.

# Today we're modeling to learn how to test a dynamic hypothesis.
Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to test a dynamic hypothesis.

**Do**
During the last session, our team ran the Base Case (bc) of no new decisions and recorded our question, hypothesis, findings and decisions in the Text section. 

**Done**
During this session we will run an experiment with the team. To prepare for that, we asked you to log in to the team world at mtl.how/sim and explore the Results Dashboard in the Expanded Outputs section for the Base Case (bc) run.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes you expect to observe in your experiment.
2. Test your dynamic hypothesis about your team's clinical priority.
3. Apply systems thinking to describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from your experiment.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

## Running an Experiment

1.	Log in to the team world at mtl.how/sim.

2.	In the middle tile on *MTL* Home, you will see the "Experiment Maintenance" tile in the middle of the screen. This is where you can review your saved runs by clicking on the down arrow to the right of "Experiment Maintenance" title in the blue bar.  In this tile you are able to *Delete*, *Rename*, or *Export* your experiments. Review your saved runs. A team may need to rename experiments if they want to be sure they are able to differentiate between experiments or if they incorrectly named a file in a prior session. If you need to rename any of your saved runs, click on the box to the left of the file name and click on the word *Rename*. You can then change the name of the file and click on the save button.

3.	On the right side of the *MTL* Home page, you will see the "Team Data Menu Maintenance" tile. In this tile you are able to *Delete*, *Rename*, or *Add* data files. Review the data files you have uploaded for use and make sure you have the data file you want. 

4.	You can *Join Current Session* or *Start a New Session* in the desired module by clicking in the circle to the right of one of those titles and then click on "Play." As a reminder, the available modules are Care Coordination, Medication Management, Psychotherapy, Aggregate, and Suicide Prevention. If you *Start a New Session* you will need to select the team data file you would like to use. Click on the "Select Team Data" icon. A pop-up box will appear on your computer screen with the text, "Please select a model input file." Click on the blue down arrow next to the text "Please select team data" and choose the data file you would like to use in an experiment.

5.	The main model tile will be in the center of your screen. The Output and Experiment sections are on the right of the screen. To refresh your memory and pick up where you left off in your *MTL* learning, expand the Experiments section by clicking on the white down arrow in the blue bar. You will see the phrase, "Select Previous Experiment to Set Experimental Values to a Former State." Click on the red down arrow and select the experiment from the last session. You will also want to check the box to include text from this session in Expanded Outputs text fields. Review those text fields.

6.	Study the system diagram and team data, and decide together what change you want to experiment with, that might give you the desired result.

7.	To create a new run building off of the previous one, revise the text in all the text boxes to reflect the experiment you want to do now: 

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.* 

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.*

8.	Adjust experiment sliders for the new experiment, keeping in mind that the previous runâ€™s settings are in effect (this time that just means all the base case/default values).

9.	Run and then Save (without resetting). Name this run according to the variable setting(s) you changed.

10.	Compare Runs to see the difference the between base case and the current experimental run. Compare Services to see how the variables across services look under the current experiment's conditions. Record what you learned:

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_findings.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Findings.** *Describe your team's findings, insights and conclusions from this experiment.* 

11.	Discuss and record what changes you may want to make in the clinic and what further experiments you want to run. 

 [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_decisions.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Decisions.** *Based on what you learned in this experiment, what changes are you ready to make in your practice?*

12. Save and Reset when ready.

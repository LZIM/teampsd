# Today we're modeling to learn how to use systems thinking.
Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to use systems thinking.

On the screen, we're showing the learner see guide for MTL session 10 available at mtl.how.  

As you can see in the Done and Do table, today we're logging into mtl.how/sim -- the sim UI.

## Learning Objectives

1.	Describe the decisions you experimented with and how they are intertwined with other decisions and clinic outcomes.
2.	Test your understanding of the system story by describing what’s happening when it produces a runaway increase or decrease in some output.
3.	Apply your thinking to anticipate the long-term trend in your clinic’s EBP reach under two different decision scenarios.


# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

1. Log in to mtl.how/sim and join the current session.
2. From the experiment tile, pull up the prior experiment and click the red "Go" button.
3. Check the box to include the text from that experiment and click "Go" again.
4. Note that the sliders have moved to the settings for that experiment.
5. Open the Expanded Outputs tile and select another earlier experiment to compare to the one you have just pulled up.
6. Note the variables that were manipulated in the two experiments.
7. Review the findings from the two experiments in the results dashboard and the text entered for Hypothesis, Findings and Decisions.

[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_hypothesis.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Hypothesis.** *Outline the systems story your team believes will cause the outcomes your team expects to observe.*

Let's describe and enter the hypothesis to test, which, this time, will consider a combination of our Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. We can review the test in the Decsion panel from Session 9, when we compared results Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. With that text entered into the hypotheis box, let's save it. -- Example for CC: We hypothesis that a combined effect of changing both the RVI (to something longer) will reduce our Missed Appointment % because there are fewer patient appts books. In addition, we hypothsisize that we can allow our new patient Referral Rate to increase to xx. At this anticipated referral rate, we will be able to integrate a more new patients into CC without negatively impacting our Team's Missed Appointment %.

8. Collapse the Expanded Outputs tile and move it to the side to reveal the system diagram.
9. Use the diagram to tell a system story about the differences in the two experiments.
10. Consider running a combination experiment that incorporates the sliders manipulated in both experiments.
11. Replace text in the Q/H/F/D boxes to reflect the team's hypotheses and expectations for the combined experiment.

12. Save, name, and run the combined experiment.
13. Discuss and record results and decisions, including your thinking about long-term trends in your clinic's EBP reach under various decision scenarios.

## That's it for modeling to learn how to use systems thinking. Next is our Done/Do review.

Today we logged in to the sim UI to run experiment 3 and explored the results using systems thinking skills. Before next time, review and compare the base case with experiments 1, 2 and 3 and think about possible clinical care changes the team could make.

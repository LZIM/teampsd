# MTL Red Part 2

Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________.
### Today we're modeling to learn from calculated team parameters.

## Done and Do (15 minutes)

| [<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/logos/mtl_how_data_sm.png" height = "75" width = "110">](http://mtl.how/data) We reviewed the HF, Diag, Enc and SP tabs in Team Data to find a patient and a team trend. We logged in to mtl.how/data and looked at the two team folders: data UI and team data table.| We will examine calculated team parameters fo CC, MM, PSY, AGG, and SP.|

## Learning Objectives
### After this session, you will be able to:

1.	Describe the parameters that are calculated by the *MTL* Data User Interface for Care Coordination (CC), Medication Management (MM), Psychotherapy (PSY), Aggregate Mix of Services (AGG) and Measurement Based Stepped Care and Suicide Prevention (SP).

2.	Test your expectations against calculated overall team statistics for CC, MM, PSY, AGG, and SP.

3.	Apply your clinical expertise to translate learnings from the *MTL* Data UI into team decisions.


# In-session Exercise (30 minutes)

## Let's get started! 

**Who would like to "drive" today?** [Recommend the Team Lead]


### When you click the "Create Team Data Table" button, it produces a table of descriptive team data.
- Data are means, medians and percentages of key variables likely to influence the team's priorities for learning from *Modeling to Learn*
- There are team data produced for each module of *Modeling to Learn*
  - Care Coordination (CC)
  - Medication Management (MM)
  - Psychotherapy (PSY)
  - Aggregate team services (AGG)
  - Measurement-based stepped care and suicide prevention (SP)

### 1. Select a module for review
- Find a variable that is important to you team. How is it estimated in this table? What are its units?
- Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?
- Check out the last two columns. What is the difference between these two columns?

### 2. Select a second module for review 
- Check out the last two columns. 
- Find a variable that is important to you team. How is it estimated in this table? What are its units?
- Where can you find even more detailed information about your team data?

### 3. Are there any team data table values you would like to explore in the team data UI?
- If so, which ones? Open the Data UI to examine your question.

### 4. Does the team see any values in the team data that seem to vary significantly from expectations?
- If so, what is surprising? Does the estimation definition (second to last column, text in red) help you to interpret the variable value?

### 5. Does the team see any values in the team data that fit your expectations about high priority team needs?
- If so, what are you noticing? In what ways does the team data fit with your day-to-day clinical practice in your team?


### That's it for *Modeling to Learn* from calculated team parameters. Next is our Done/Do review.

### DO demo

1. We encourage you to look around in the team data table before next time. Test whether you can find a piece of data you decide to look for. Just take a minute, if you can, to become familiar with the format and content of the data table. 

2. Remember, you can click through the Params tabs, one for each module, to dig into the details of how each parameter is calculated in the text columns to the right of the numerical data.   

## Until next time, thank you for _Modeling to Learn_!

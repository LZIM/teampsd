**Done**  

In our last session, we used mtl.how/sim to compare the base case to experiment 1, experiment 2 and experiment 3. Possible decisions or changes the team could make in clinical care based on what we learned were explored.

**Do**  

In today's session, we will review what the team has learned from examining the systems stories for each experiment and prioritize ways to implement those learnings in to our clinical care.

## Learning Objectives

1.	Describe what your team has prioritized as decisions to implement in your clinic. 
2.	Test your team’s plan against your individual and shared, team vision.
3.	Apply your team’s plan in clinical decisions.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Connect learning and decisions from experiments to original team vision, question, and need

1.  What shared vision did the team decide on in session 1?  
   + In session 1 the team created a shared vision for moving through the *Modeling to Learn* process. Our experiments and decisions throughout the *MTL* course have tied to this vision.
   
2.  What team need and questions did we identify?  
   + In session 4 the team completed the mtl.how/menu. Using the results from the Menu, the team created a shared vision for moving through the *Modeling to Learn* process. The experiments and decisions throughout the *MTL* course have tied to this vision.

3.  What hypotheses did we test?  
   + We're now going to expand the Experiments section by clicking on the white down arrow in the blue bar. You will see the phrase, "Select Previous Experiment to Set Experimental Values to a Former State." Let's click on the red down arrow and select one experiment from the list, preferably the experiment the team ran first. When you click the red "Go" button, a blue and white pop up box will appear with the title "Review Previous Settings." All of the values showing in the Experimental Values box will show the variables and numbers you changed for this experiment and those that remained at BC or base case. Check the box next to the text "Include text from this session in Expanded Outputs text fields?" This will allow you to see the text that was entered for Our Question, Our Hypothesis, Our Findings, Our Decisions. To bring up the text boxes for easy review, click on the Output section. Click on Expand. Click on the layered squares or windows in the upper right corner of the blue bar to make the text box smaller so it's easy to review the text in the text boxes and main model diagram.
   + Let's examine the *Our Hypothesis* text for each experiment (1, 2 and 3). 
   
4.  What insights we will keep in mind as we make clinic decisions?
   + Following each experiment, we documented *Our Findings* after reviewing results and making comparisons across experiments.
   + The insights that were gained from reviewing the experimental results led to a documentation of *Our Decisions* in the final text box.  

5.  What new approaches or targets do we want to focus on?
   + Based on the 3 experiments, the team has the opportunity to select one approach that could be adopted in the clinic.
   + Examples of clinic decisions were to extend RVI, shift appointment supply from one service to another or from existing patients to new patients, and to change the patient engagement time.
   
6.  What concrete actions can the team take in the real world?
   + The team has the opportunity to use the *MTL* experimental results and the team's data to take action in the clinic.
   + Examine which finding and decision is of greatest interest to your team and decide the plan of action that would be necessary to adopt this strategy in the clinic.

7.  How do these decisions align with the team's shared vision, question and needs?

8.  What data will we watch to see how we're doing?

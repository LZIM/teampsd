# Today we're modeling to learn how to make future team decisions.
Hello! I'm __________ and I'm __________ [Co-facilitators introduce themselves]. Today we're modeling to learn how to make future team decisions.

### As you can see in the Done/Do table in the Learner See Guide:

## Learning Objectives

1.	Describe what your team has prioritized as decisions to implement in your clinic. 
2.	Test your team’s plan against your individual and shared, team vision.
3.	Apply your team’s plan in clinical decisions.

### Let's get started:

## In-session Exercise (30 minutes): Pulling together team learnings, decisions, and vision

1. Throughout *Modeling to Learn*, we've made lots of team decisions. Let's review them and see what they mean for future decisions.

2. In session 1, we created a shared vision for *Modeling to Learn*. We've tied our experiments and decisions throughout *MTL* to that vision.  
   
3. In sessions 2 and 3 we explored team data and trends using the *MTL* data UI. We learned how to find an individual patient, how to visualize trends over time for our own care or the teams's as a whole. And we built our team data file for use in the sim.

4. In session 4 we completed the *MTL* Menu. Looking at the results, we identified our team need and which of the 5 *MTL* modules would be best for exploring it over the next 6 sessions.

5. In sessions 5 through 10 we used the sim UI to focus on our team need. Let's look at our most recent *tt* report, where we can review the questions and hypotheses of all of the experiments we ran.
    
6. Now let's review what we learned from those experiments, as recorded in our findings and decisions, and think about what it means for the team going forward:
   + What insights we will keep in mind as we make future team decisions?
   + What new decisions, approaches, or targets do we want to adopt in our team?  
   + Let's think about the key insights we've gotten about decisions that are within our control.
   + What concrete actions will we take?
   + How do those decisions align with our team's vision and needs?  
   + What data will we watch to see how we're doing?  

### That's it for _Modeling to Learn_ how to make future team decisions. Next is our Done/Do review.

### DO demo

1. After we complete *Modeling to Learn* next time, you can still access the *MTL* module we used and all the experiments we saved in the Team and Individual worlds. 

2. You can also use any of the other 4 modules to experiment and inform future team decisions. Let's pull up each of the modules and look at some of their unique features:

+ In Care Coordination (CC), we can compare multiple experiments and look at things like how Overwork Affects No-Shows and how we Balance New and Existing Patients.

+ In Medication Management (MM) we can experiment with team decisions across different diagnostic cohorts and how best to allocate appointments for our providers with and without x-waivers.

+ In Psychotherapy (PSY), we can look at the engagement patterns of patients with different diagnoses; and a unique feature in this module is the Sankey diagram, which shows the patient engagement and appointment usage flows.

+ In Aggregate (AGG), we can test hypotheses about our mix of services. The unique feature here is in the Outputs section, we can choose to compare different experiments, as we've done in other modules, or we can compare the effects of a given experiment on the different services. 

+ Finally, the Measurement Based Stepped Care for Suicide Prevention module allows the team to conduct experiments in multiple views.

3. For next time, be thinking about possible next steps after *MTL*.

## Until then, thank you for *Modeling to Learn*!

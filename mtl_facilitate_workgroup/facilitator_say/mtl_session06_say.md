## Done and Do

Last session we uploaded the team data file and logged in to mtl.how/sim. We chose the _____ module to work in and we checked out the main page of the sim UI, especially focusing on the Team Data Table in the Experiments section. We started recording questions and more in the Text section.

Were you able to log in to your individual world and look at the “i” information in the Model Diagram and Experiments section? What did you find? Do you have any questions?

Today we will tell a systems story about the team’s top priority using the Model Diagram in the sim UI.

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe the systems story of your team's highest priority. 
2. Test out your thinking about causes of team challenges using the model diagram.
3. Apply clinical expertise to develop a question for team learning using simulation.

# In-session Exercise (30 minutes): The Model Diagram and Systems Story

1.	For this session, you should go ahead and log in to your Individual world at **mtl.how/sim**. That way you'll be able to play along with our scavenger hunt, pausing the video to see if you can find the answers in the sim UI to the questions we ask, and then come back to the video. To log in to your Individual world, enter your log-in credentials and click **LOGIN**, then select the world that starts with **"ind" from the drop-down menu**. Once you're on the _MTL_ Home Page, look over on the **left section with Session in the blue heading bar**. If you've gone into the _ Module before, you'll see the **name of the module and the dataset you chose under the first option**, Join Current Session. If so, select that and hit Play. If not, look **below and select the _ module**. Select Team Data will appear. Click on that and choose the team dataset from the drop-down menu. Then hit **Play**. (If you don't see any data to select in the Team Data menu, go back to the instructions in Session 4 to see how to upload your team dataset.) 

Now check what you're seeing against what we're showing on the video. It should look the same, except that it will have YOUR team's name at the **top left**, and YOUR name and photo at the **top right**, and YOUR team's dataset listed in the **blue bar of the main section above the model diagram, here**. Also, depending on the size of your monitor and whether your browser window is full-screen or less, you might see more or less than what we're showing of the model diagram. It's a dynamic graphic, so if you re-size the browser window by clicking the **boxes icon in the top right** and adjust its size, you can get more or less of the diagram to show up at once.

2.	OK, we're going to ask a series of questions. Your job is to find the answer in the Model Diagram.

Question 1: Over what time frame does an experiment run?

-pause- 

Answer: You can find the time frame in the **Experiment Timeline section up at the top of the model diagram section**. Experiments simulate the plausible future out **two years from today**.

Question 2: Where can you find descriptions for the variables in the Model Diagram? How is the variable, Actual Hours Available for Service, described?

-pause-

Answer: The **small circles with i inside throughout the sim UI** provide additional information when you click on them. If you click **this one by Actual Hours Available for Service**, you see, "The clinician time available for a service depends on the total clinical hours available, the relative increase in hours due to overtime, and the % allocated to a service."

Question 3: What happens in the diagram when you “Reveal Complexity?”

-pause-

Answer: Options to Reveal Complexity are found **under the Experiment Timeline** in each module. You can select any combination of check-boxes to bring more of the model diagram into view, or uncheck them to make it less visually complex. You should know that the amount of the model diagram being shown does NOT have anything to do with how the model itself is running when you run experiments - it's ONLY an option to let you control how much of the actual model's complexity you're viewing in the diagram. When we **check Supply Affects Patient Services**, some extra, light blue causal loop arrows appear **at the bottom of the diagram**. Checking **Effects of Overtime** brings up additional, dark blue arrows **on the right side of the diagram**. You can play with those options and study what happens.

Question 4: What are the units of time in mtl.how/sim?

-pause-

Answer: 

3.	Now we’ll use the Model Diagram to tell a systems story about the needs and questions the team identified as your priority. (How to create scripts for this for all the modules and various priorities?) As we do this, we’ll try to zero in on a specific question or questions that you’d like to explore through simulation experiments. My co-facilitator will try to capture those in the Question text box so we don’t lose track.  Facilitator leads discussion, using mouse to trace on Model Diagram, eliciting more clinical perspective from the team to pin down their question(s).



[<img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/resources/icons/mtl_question.png" height = "50" width = "50" style = "display: inline-block"/>](http://mtl.how/sim) **Our Question.** *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.* 

## Done and Do

We told a systems story about our team’s top priority and began recording our questions in the Text section.

Next time, we’ll run our first simulation – the Base Case of no new decisions. Before next time, we’d like you to log in to your individual world at mtl.how/sim and type your question and hypothesis about the Base Case into the Text section. The question is really just, “What will clinic care look like over the next two years if we make no new decisions?” Give some thought to what you expect and write a sentence or two describing your hypothesis to prepare for our running that simulation next time.

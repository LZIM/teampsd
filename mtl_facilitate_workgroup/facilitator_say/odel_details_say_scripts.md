 ## Aggregate Mix of Services
+ Team Need: 
+ System Story: 
+ Base Case:
  + Q - We would happen if we made no new decisions in our team?
  + H - That patients will continue accumulate waiting for care.
  + F - Run an experiment that accounts for the loss of two providers.
  + D - We saw oscillating system behavior.
    
+ Experiment 1:
  + Q - What happens if we lose two providers AND then reduce how we make patient triage decisions -- to send half as many people to PSY and CC as we did before the hours for those services were also cut in half?
  + H - We expect that wait times will not go up as much, as we have cut demand for those services.
  + F - Decision is for people to experiment with sensitivity sliders on own and follow up.
  + D - We found RVI for PSY stretched way out to several weeks between visits and work pressure increased really quickly then came back down. Saw far less pts in PSY over next 2 years. 
    
+ Experiment 2: 
  + Q - If we lose two MHTC/psychotherapists, what is the impact on medication management?
  + H - We are increasing the proportion of our services for med management by 25% and increasing telephone services by 25%. This is likely increasing work pressure. This it will increase no-shows and wait times for med management. (Sensitivity of Patient's Engagement Time to Provider Fatigue, Sensitivity of Scheduled Return Visit Interval to Work Pressure, Sensitivity of Overtime to Work Pressure)
  + F - Patients waiting to start oscillates. Work pressure spikes in about 3 months.
  + D - Continue to review additional findings.
   
+ Experiment 3:

  + D

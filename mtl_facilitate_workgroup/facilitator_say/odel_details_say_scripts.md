 ## Psychotherapy
+ Team Need: 
+ System Story: 
+ Base Case:
  + Q -  What would happen over the next two years if we made no new decisions in our team?
  + H - We expect that we will continue to see fewer Psy and EBPsy patients than we want because we aren't graduating our psychotherapy patients.
  + F - We were rigth 65% of our patients are in care for more than 3 months. For our next experiment we will reduce the duration of of engagement of patients after 3 months by 75%. - Sankey diagram showed that for  the median number of visits is 16 for 75% of patients."
  + D - For our next experiment we will reduce the duration of of engagement of patients after 3 months by 75%.

+ Experiment 1:
  + Q - What if we graduate more patients who complete 8 or more psychotherapy sessions in their first 3 months?
  + H - We expect that if we increase our completers who graduate  to 50% , then we'll free up more slots in the clinic for more patients to start psychoterhapy/EBPsy.
  + F - We found that we increased the start rate for psychotherapy, but not by as much as we'd hoped.
  + D - For experiment 2, we will try to step more patients down out of psychotherapy/EBPsy who are engaged for greater than 3 months.   
    
+ Experiment 2: 
  + Q - For experiment 2, we will try to step more patients down out of psychotherapy/EBPsy who are engaged for greater than 3 months.
  + H - We expect that if we reduce the median engagement >3 months to 12 visits (meaning a 75% reduction), then it will free up "a lot of appointment space
  + F - Against the base case - Our starting rate increased from ~3 ppw to 7 ppw. - We went from having ~4 apw  to ~8 apw .
  + D - We decided to run a third experiment on your own in your individual world. So that next time we are prepared to think through new decisions we might make in our team.

+ Experiment 3: 
  + Q
  + H
  + F
  + D

 ## Aggregate Mix of Services
+ Team Need: 
+ System Story: 
+ Base Case:
  + Q - We would happen if we made no new decisions in our team?
  + H - That patients will continue accumulate waiting for care.
  + F - Run an experiment that accounts for the loss of two providers.
  + D - We saw oscillating system behavior.
    
+ Experiment 1:
  + Q - What happens if we lose two providers AND then reduce how we make patient triage decisions -- to send half as many people to PSY and CC as we did before the hours for those services were also cut in half?
  + H - We expect that wait times will not go up as much, as we have cut demand for those services.
  + F - Decision is for people to experiment with sensitivity sliders on own and follow up.
  + D - We found RVI for PSY stretched way out to several weeks between visits and work pressure increased really quickly then came back down. Saw far less pts in PSY over next 2 years. 
    
+ Experiment 2: 
  + Q - If we lose two MHTC/psychotherapists, what is the impact on medication management?
  + H - We are increasing the proportion of our services for med management by 25% and increasing telephone services by 25%. This is likely increasing work pressure. This it will increase no-shows and wait times for med management. (Sensitivity of Patient's Engagement Time to Provider Fatigue, Sensitivity of Scheduled Return Visit Interval to Work Pressure, Sensitivity of Overtime to Work Pressure)
  + F - Patients waiting to start oscillates. Work pressure spikes in about 3 months.
  + D - Continue to review additional findings.

Session 8. In-session exercise: Running an Experiment

1.	Login to your world.

2.	Review your saved runs. Rename your saved runs if you feel you need to.

3.	Review the data files you have uploaded for use and make sure you have what you want.

4.	You can *Join Current Session* or *Start a New Session* in the Aggregate module. If you *Start a New Session* select the team data file you’d like to use.

5.	To refresh your memory and pick up where you left off last time, Select the experiment from the last session and check the box to include text from this session in Expanded Outputs text fields. Review those text fields.

6.	Study the system diagram and team data, and decide together what change you want to experiment with, that might give you the desired result.

7.	Revise the text in all the text boxes to reflect the experiment you want to do now: Type in your question and hypothesis, leave the other 2 fields blank.

8.	Adjust the experiment sliders for the new experiment, keeping in mind that the previous run’s settings are in effect (this time that just means all the base case values).

9.	Run; then Save (without resetting). Name this run according to the variable setting you changed.

10.	Compare Runs to see the difference between base case and the current run.

11.	Compare Services to see how the ones you modified look now.

12.	Record your Findings in the text box.

13.	Decide what you want to look into next. Record your decisions in the text box. Save and Reset when ready.

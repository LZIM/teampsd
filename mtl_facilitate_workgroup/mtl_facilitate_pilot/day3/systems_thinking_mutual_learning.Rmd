# *MTL* Sessions 9 and 10: Mutual Learning: Mutual Learning: Systems Thinking - Complex, Feedback, Behavior, Time

Ask David to create scripts for this exercise. 
Resources needed: Draft 3 short team dialogues about AGG that each use all four dimensions of systems thinking. 
The readers of the dialogue wil be team PSD members. 
These sections of dialogue can come from the team meeting notes in the qualitative workgroup folder. 
Use the systems thinking codebook for reference.  
The purpose is to  ask the MTL Facilitate Pilot learners to identify the dimensions of systems thinking present in the dialogue.  
There should be at least one that has all four dimensions.

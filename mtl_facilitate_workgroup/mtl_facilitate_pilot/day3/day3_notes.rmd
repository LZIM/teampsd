## Sticky
1. Going to be a very cool tool. Focus on what is actually affecting things in the system
2. We have dashboards that show data, but this is a tool that uses that data. 
3. Interactability
4. Can make specific decisions in a way that you have to extrapolate from other decisions. 
5. We can make hypotheses, but usually it takes 3-5 months to see effect. Shows decisions quickly.
6. Can see complexity of issue w/majority of pieces.
7. Dashboards in a thousand places. Lot of frontline staff tend to discount data. Makes data more approachable and less intimidating.  Still don't understand other dashboards/can't make it do what they want. Being able to customize data into exactly what you want and need without needing to know programming. Sim brings data to life in a visual way.
8. Data - I don't have to know what to click to get it. Doesn't seem like I can break it.
9. For seasoned staff, Excel spreadsheet is approachable and easy to use. By having it so specific to encounters, a clinician can look at that and look at the individual patients. They can filter and sort into something that makes sense for them.
10. Plus and minus: plus is additive or positive. negative is inverse effect. Feedback loops. Odd # of neg signs = balancing loop. Even # of neg signs = reinforcing loop. Virtuous or vicious.

## Session 7 Questions/Notes
- How do I get my data in?
- Is the Q/H/F/D dynamic per run or static over all runs?
- How do we save text put in Q/H/F/D
- What is basecase?
- I'd be interested in knowing current wait times and EBP delivery in services?
- Why would we hypothesize that things stay the same if our goal is to improve? Why don't we hypothesize to improve access with a certain change?
- I thought we were never supposed to hypothesize the null
- Why would we spend our time looking at the (basecase) hypothesis (where nothing is changing)
- What are we looking at from the starting point today?
- What are we doing and where are we going?
- We haven't talked about data showing up on our screens
- Running basecase and using it as comparison assumes that things happened before happened intentionally and aren't random
- This is like the first session with astronauts (running simulations).
- How is there no one waiting to start services? Does not match what we think we're doing in our team
- Can I click on more than one service at a time?
- Ability to switch between Service Proportions from Team Data or Appropriate Service Proportions from Supply is cool!
- Who defines what is appropriate service proportions?
- We need to get our patients back into PCMHI?
- What does the green mean?
- What is difference between red and green toggle sliders? They are the same items. Our hypothesis is if you want to make changes you toggle on the green.
- Talking about efficiencies we see some providers twiddling thumbs while others are on hamster wheel
- How do you run a basecase?
- I think our hypothesis is that we currently think our rates of referral don't match up with our appt supply. If we adjust our own referral rates, we'll achieve a new steady state with different proportions. 
- It changes because what we do as people is a workaround.  But that is suboptimal.  What we can do moving forward is find an optimal solution and apply that.
- What do we select on display patient services to run the experiment?
- How do we know if we ran it?
- What does number mean in the save tile? How do we save?
- What made the spikes in the basecase run?
- Would this be the same (the spike occuring) regardless of whether I ran this 3 months from now?
- If system will balance everything out anyway, why do I care?
- What do we think about changing? What are we able to change? How much are we changing?
- I can't change my grids. I can't change my tour. But I have to see 17 people with the time to see 5.
- When we make no new decisions with our current appt supply and patient demand for psy, access to psychotx worsens/wait times will double within 6 months from 2 to 4 weeks on our team. Didn't increase wait times for intake because 
- If we do nothing, it will get worse, but the system will conspire to get it at a level that is tolerable.
- Intake is the first things that happens when someone is new to MH. Intake doesn't happen again once on team. They may get cc, mm, psy, ebpsy, etc. or multiple things at once. Demands that are happening, happen amongst ourselves to meeting this patients' needs.




## Tech Issues/Suggestions
1. Notification in chat when someone sends a message
2. Why do green variables have BC in AGG? Why are the green BC values defined here and not in other places? Intake Evaluation Rate is also green with BC, but no way to find the value.

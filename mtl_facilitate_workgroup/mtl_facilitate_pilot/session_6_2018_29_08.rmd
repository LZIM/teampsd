# **In-session Exercise 1: Where in the MTL World Is….**  
-- 22 minutes  
* Our first activity today is *Where in the MTL World is…*  
* We are going to be using the chat box. I will guide you, step by step, through finding certain items on the MTL.how/sim main tile for the Care Coordination or CC model.  
* A *cheat sheet* for today’s activity -- *Where in the MTL World Is…* -- was sent with this week’s email. In case you prefer a hard copy, the questions I’m going to ask are on that cheat sheet.  
* The purpose for this activity is to familiarize you with the main tile in the model diagram so you can easily find information and numbers that change in the model as you run experiments.  
+ I’m going to be typing a series of 10 questions into the chat box, one at a time, as well as reading them aloud.  
+ Please do the action requested in the question. Find the answer and “chat” it back to me by typing your answer into the chat box. 

*If at any time you are not sure what I’m asking for or how to find something, type “help” in the chat box and I will provide assistance by sending a hint or giving verbal support over the phone to all participants.

1. Question 1: The main model screen shows two main categories on which experiments are run in CC – what are the 2 categories? (Hint: far left side of main diagram tile)  
+ Answer:  Appointments and Patients  

2. Question 2:  Information circles are blue with an I in the middle. Read the text in the “i” circle for “Appointments in CC.” Type the first 5 words of the text in the “i” circle for “Appointments in CC” into the chat box.  
+ Answer:  Total number of appointments booked…  

3. Question 3:  Read the text the “i” circle for “Patients in CC.” Type the last 5 words of the text in the “i” circle for “Patients in CC” into the chat box.  
+ Answer:  … the model comes to equilibrium.  

4. Question 4:  The model explores the future possibilities for managing appointments and patients. Over how many years is an experiment run (Hint: Experiment Timeline)?  
+ Answer: 2 years  

5. Question 5: In one sentence, tell me generally what happens to the screen when you click on the squares next to the 3 “Reveal Complexity” buttons?  
+ Answer:  Arrows and boxes are revealed to show balancing patients, overbooking affects no-shows, and how wait time affects referrals.  

6. Question 6: What is the number in the “True Missed Appointment Rate” dial?  
+ Answer:  ____  

7. Question 7: Find Appointment Supply. What types of appointments are at the end of the two arrows leading away from Appointment Supply?  
+ Answer: Appointments for Existing Patients & for New Patients  

8. Question 8:  What is the total number of patients “Waiting to Start” care coordination?  
+ Answer: ____  

9. Question 9: What text is in the two “Effect of” or sensitivity buttons on the model diagram?  
+ Answer:  Effect of Task Time on Missed Appointments & Effect of Wait Time on Referrals  

10. Question 10:  There are two “balancing loops” in the CC model. What are they? (Hint: A balancing loop is indicated by a capital “B” with an arrow wrapped around it.)  
+ Answer:  Balancing Existing and New Patients; Wait Time Affects Referrals

11. Bonus Question:  
What is the importance of the boxes that are “red” on the main tile? What is different about them?
+ Answers:  
1. The red boxes are the things that we can control or change in the model. 
2. They have sliders that we can move up and down.

# *Where in the MTL World Is…* Activity Review  
* Now that we’ve explored the main tile in the CC model, what questions do you have about what you’re seeing on the screen?  
* Facilitator: ANSWER QUESTIONS  
* Great, now let’s work through the model in detail to get to the next objective today – to tell the CC systems story.  

# **In-session Exercise 2: Telling the CC System Story**  
-- 18 minutes  

* Let’s review some screen shots of the Appointments & Patients diagrams in the CC model. 
* Slide 1 shows you the basic flow for Care Coordination Appointments. Will someone just walk through what they see on the screen?  
+ *Facilitator* - participants should walk through patients being booked for a CC appointment, attending those CC appointments and completing the CC appointments.  

* Great, thanks NAME. Let’s go to Slide 2. Slide 2 shows the basic flow for Patients as they enter into Care Coordination. Read through this flow – patients are starting in CC services, they participate in CC, and they end CC at a certain rate.  
+ The median engagement in CC represents what…?  
+ What in this map makes sense or doesn’t make sense?  

* So we’ve just explored the basic system maps for Appointments and Patients in the main tile of the CC model. 
* Now, let’s add complexity to the model. First, let’s add to the Appointments system.  
* To do this, we click on the *Overbooking Affects No-Shows* in the *Reveal Complexity* section of the model diagram in the upper right.  
* You can see the basic model we have already reviewed at the bottom of the image, specifically the *Booking Rate*, *Appointments in CC*, and *Completing Rate.* Remember to click on the *I* in the blue circle to see how these are defined.
* First, let’s review the meaning of the colored boxes.  
+ Red boxes mean…  
+ Green boxes mean…  
+ Purple boxes mean…  

* So, we can see in the systems map where we revealed *Overbooking Affects No-Shows* that appointments are a little bit more complex than just booking and completing appointments. There is complexity added to the model. Let’s walk through these system additions. First, follow the blue line leaving from *Completing Rate.* Where does it lead to?  
+ Right, to *True Missed Appointment Rate.* What does this relationship tell you?

* Now, there is another arrow blue arrow coming in from the right side of the model to the True Missed Appointment Rate. Where does that line with arrow originate?
+ Correct, from *Overbooks* - the green box. What does a green box mean again?
+ Right, a green box means…  

* Why would Overbooks tie back to True Missed Appointments?
+ Right, because veterans are waiting for appointments. If a clinic has a certain percentage of appointments that are missed each week, they don’t want to lose time for serving others. So they, may overbook to be able to fill the missed appointment slots.  It is also the case that…  

* Let’s “Reveal Complexity” on the Patient section of the CC model by clicking on *Wait Time Affects Referrals.*
* You can see the basic model we have already reviewed, specifically the *Starting Rate*, *Patients in CC*, and *Ending Rate.* Remember to click on the *I* in the blue circle to see how these are defined.  
* When you reveal complexity, what two concepts appear in the Patients section of the systems model? A hint is to think in terms of the colored boxes. Right, we’ve added referral rates in the green slider box and target wait times in the red slider box. So the story in the Patients section of the model is that there may be patients waiting to start care coordination. This happens as veterans are being referred at a certain rate from different clinics to the CC service. The clinic receiving the referrals would like to keep the wait time at a specific target for new and existing patients.  
* What do you think happens to referrals if the wait times for patients increases to a long wait for veterans? Would referrals increase or decrease and why?
+ Yes, the referrals to the clinic in this model would likely decrease if other clinics knew that the wait time to get into CC in this clinic were really long.  
+ The capital *B* surrounded by the half-circle or *loop* with an arrow at the end means this is a balancing loop. In our model we may have a gap between the goal of keeping our wait time at a certain length and taking in referrals. As the discrepancy between the two increases, actions will have to be taken in the CC model to adjust patients flowing in the system so the wait time gap decreases.

* OK, let’s reveal another layer of complexity. Click on *Balancing Patients.”  
* Now we see the parts of the system where patients and appointments are linked together in the model.  
* NEED TO REVIEW RVI, APPOINTMENT SUPPLY, BALANCING NEW & EXISTING PATIENTS.  

# Systems Story Review
* Final Slide – let’s have each team member take a section of the system and walk through the connections.

    1. Data UI
    
   <img src =  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_facilitate_pilot/evaluation/evaluation_plots/data_ui.png>
    
    2. Sim UI
    
    <img src =  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lzim/teampsd/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/mtl_facilitate_pilot/evaluation/evaluation_plots/sim_ui.png>
    
    3. Facilitation Guide and Resources

Other comments on this question: 
1. As we discussed, perhaps w/some Pre-orientation, it would have been easier to 'get' the data interface. But for now, I would have liked to have spent more time on it.  Would have liked the facilitator guides ahead of time to use along w/the training.
2. As mentioned in our comments during the training, more up front orientation to the Facilitator Guide would have been helpful.
3. As we touched on, it would have been helpful to have the facilitation guides up front.   Sim UI: more time to play would be helpful, but it was a good intro/baseline 
4. Not sure that this could be adjusted within the 24 hour time frame but also not sure that it should be.  May be worth an expectation to 'play' at home and come back after the 24 hours of training rather than adding in classroom time.

Other comments on this question:
1. I think it depends on the front line staff. i think it is still very high level and would be challenging for front line staff to comprehend. 
2. I think the teams will feel like they've already defined their values and their needs, BUT,  after going through the model together, I think this will be valuable (but the buy in and connection to why these steps have value will be necessary to underscore for sufficient buy-in)

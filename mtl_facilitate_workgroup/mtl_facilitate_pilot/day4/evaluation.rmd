- Questions about training - Striking right balance between facilitator skills vs. learning MTL resources tools
- Are we on the right track in providing the tools to support facilitation - session guides, fidelity checklist, mtl.how
- Relative to total available time for course, time we spent going over data UI was... sim UI... facilitation guide & resources...
- In the 24 hours spent on MTL, the proportion of time spent on data UI... sim UI...
- Following up on this training, I think I will need the most help with data UI..
- Best modality/approach to me gaining the skills I will still need is...

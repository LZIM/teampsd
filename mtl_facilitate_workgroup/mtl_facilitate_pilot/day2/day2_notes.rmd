## Questions & Notes
1. Hardcoding RVI as one for EBP, sends an unintended message that this is very important and that RVI for other types of encounters are not as critical (i.e. sends message that regular psychotx can happen whenever). But, in order to get the model to run, a value is necessary there since some places do EBP's so seldom that this may be 0.  Calli
2. Ask team to look through all the questions in mtl.how/menu before priortizing so they can think about it in comparison to each other  

**mtl.how/menu**  
- Clarifying frame of reference for answering questions, especially where there is a lot of variability
- Keeping in mind the specific mix of disciplinesi in the team and how needs vary per discipline

**mtl.how/sim**
- Individual world: For your own private play
- Team World: For facilitation, teaching, working as a team
- Chat function - First thing TAS team asked about, spent large portion of time clarifying team vs. facilitator chat
- Team chat: Between team lead and facilitator
  - Facilitator chat: Between facilitators
  - Change generic photo in mtl.how/sim to be genderless
- Team Data "i" = tells you where information came from for team data
- Experiment "i" = tells you what you're changing in the model when you adjust that variable in the experiment
- Default value for experiment values are..?
  - BC/basecase value if from team data (you can check the value in the team data table at the top)
    - Slider will not reflect the value of BC. It will be left most.
    - Red variables only
  - Default value if not from team data
    - Green and purple variables
- What are the colors?
  - Red = read in
  - Green = variable you can experiment with not pulled in from team data
  - Purple = always set as default at middle position (value = 1); dimesionless variable; allows you to experiment with the effects of one variable on another; effects that we know are important but don't have concrete data for
- What is team data for starting rate? Look at the "i" icon!
- Add to Facilitator script: Ability to select previous experiment runs to set values in Experiments tile to a previous run
- 3 Tiles in Play Screen: Main Tile, Outputs Tile, Experiments Tile
- Rates: Unit of time is in weeks (The time unit of week is best for mental visualization as each day varies a lot and too much has happened by end of a month)
- Complexity  vs. complicated
- Slider = something that can be experimented with in Experiments tile
- Care Coordination systems story: If I start overbooking, this increases appt supply, and decreases measured vs. actual time
- Signs on arrows: Causal effect, not just correlational; Direct vs. Inverse relationship; Same vs. Opposite relationship
- Dynamics before details: Looking at the larger cause/effect relationship before the detailed values
- Bathtub analogy for rates flowing in and out of stock: Rate of faucet filling tub vs. rate of drainage of tub
- We can say "impact" instead of "related to" since this is (multi)causality not correlational.
- Clinicians often feel disempowered by solutions/programs from leaderhips as they are presented to be "simple," but MTL addressed the complexity of the clinic

## Empty My Cup
- Time it takes for feedback to take effect
- What it means to increase target wait-time
- If it's an odd number of negatives than it's a balancing loop; even number of negatives is a reinforcing loop
- CC may be hard to explain given stop codes; SW/nursing work may be changing
- Need more examples
- Every system is perfectly designed to get outcome it gets
- How my team is put together
- Huge problem we see everywhere is that people don't get the flow component

## Debrief
- Telling the system story as a group (rather than in pairs) both helps TeamPSD members better understand the model and helps brings in the diverse expertise across the board in telling the story and answering questions
- We need to move on from CC to other models that are more relevant to the clinicans they work with/questions they get in the field. We will work on telling systems story for an Agg model.
- Session 7 tomorrow morning: Q and H for basecase. TeamPSD will facilitate the TAS team to understand that the Hypothesis for basecase will show a fluctuating and then stabilizing graph due to the balancing loops. Folks will run experiments on their own.

## Tech Issues
1. Referral rate in Experiments Tile in CC model in team_mtl_facilitate_pilot_2018_09 world has "BC"
2. The "i" information for "Measured vs. Actual Time" in Care Coordination is incorret. The current definition is for wait time right.
3. "i" information in diagram is too complex - "Effect of Task Time on Missed Appointments"
4. "Appointments for existing patients" in MM model does not have "i" information
5. "Appointments used by existing patients" in PSY model does not have "i" information. 
6. PSY still says "Appointments used by existing patients" instead of "Appointments for existing patients" which we standardized to

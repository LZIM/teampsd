## Questions & Notes
1. Hardcoding RVI as one for EBP, sends an unintended message that this is very important and that RVI for other types of encounters are not as critical (i.e. sends message that regular psychotx can happen whenever). But, in order to get the model to run, a value is necessary there since some places do EBP's so seldom that this may be 0.  Calli
2. Ask team to look through all the questions in mtl.how/menu before priortizing so they can think about it in comparison to each other

mtl.how/menu
- Clarifying frame of reference for answering questions, especially where there is a lot of variability
- Keeping in mind the specific mix of disciplinesi in the team and how needs vary per discipline

mtl.how/sim
- Individual world: For your own private play
- Team World: For facilitation, teaching, working as a team
- Chat function - First thing TAS team asked about, spent large portion of time clarifying team vs. facilitator chat
- Team chat: Between team lead and facilitator
  - Facilitator chat: Between facilitators
  - Change generic photo in mtl.how/sim to be genderless
- Team Data "i" = tells you where information came from for team data
- Experiment "i" = tells you what you're changing in the model when you adjust that variable in the experiment
- Default value for experiment values are..?
  - BC/basecase value if from team data (you can check the value in the team data table at the top)
    - Slider will not reflect the value of BC. It will be left most.
    - Red variables only
  - Default value if not from team data
    - Green and purple variables
- What are the colors?
  - Red = read in
  - Green = 
  - Purple = 
- What is team data for starting rate? Look at the "i" icon!

## Tech Issues
1. Referral rate in Experiments Tile in CC model in team_mtl_facilitate_pilot_2018_09 world has "BC"

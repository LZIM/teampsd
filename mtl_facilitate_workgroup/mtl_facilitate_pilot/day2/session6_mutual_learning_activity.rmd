# MTL Facilitate Pilot

## Session 6 Mutual Learning Activity - Telling the CC System Story

  + Tools: *MTL.how/sim*  
  + Resources: Flip charts, markers, sticky notes, tape
  + Preparation: Pre-draw basic Appointments and Patients structure on flip chart pages.
  + Format: *MTL Facilitate Learners* will work in two groups.

 + Understand complex relationships between appointments and patients in the CC model
 + Tell the CC systems story
 + Develop a team question that will lead to an experiment in the CC model.

* Purpose:  This exercise is about making sense of complexity. This is a process of discovery and thinking about complexity in an orderly way that allows you to tell the CC systems story so that you can help others understand the complexity of managing patients and appointments in the VA health system. It will also encourage development of a question for running an experiment in the CC model.  

### Activity

* Divide the *MTL Facilitate Learners* into 2 groups (count off by 2's). Half are the “Appointments” group; half are in the “Patients” group. 
* Three TeamPSD members will join the Appointments group (TR-lead facilitator, DL, DK). Three TeamPSD members will join the Patients group (LZ-lead facilitator, JB, SP).  
* Each group will have a flip chart page with the basic structure for each segment of the model, *Appointments* and *Patients*, drawn on it:  
++ Appointments: Booking Rate, Appointments in CC, Completing Rate {gif} and True Missed Appointment Rate, Appointments to Reschedule and Rescheduling Rate  
++ Patients: Starting Rate, Patients in CC, Ending Rate {gif}
* Each group will be given a marker and sticky notes with words written on them that represent the other parts of their section of the model. 
* The *MTL Facilitate Learners* will re-create their assigned segment of the model, drawing in the arrows and symbols, with support from their TeamPSD team members (8 minutes).  
* The two groups will join the two flip chart pages together, receive additional sticky notes with model segments, and will draw in the Balancing Patients content of the model.  
* TeamPSD lead facilitators will support the merged group in walking through the CC systems story (12 minutes).  
* The *MTL Facilitate Learners* will turn their attention to the screen (seated or standing) on which the CC model and team data table is displayed.  
* TeamPSD lead facilitators will walk the *MTL Facilitate Learners* through the process of drafting text for *Our Question* in which the team will *Briefly describe what your team wants to learn from this experiment.*  
* One *MTL Facilitate Learner* will enter the question into the box Outputs tile. 

* Final Step – Sit down and debrief the experience and walk through the CC systems story a final time.

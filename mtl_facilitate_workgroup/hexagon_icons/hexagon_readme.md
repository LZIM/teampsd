# Team Participatory Sytem Dynamics 

* Team PSD is using R and rMarkdown to format our participatory system dynamics facilitation resources.
* Posting our work on GitHub enables transparency, reproducibility and team collaboration.
* We are also using the RQDA package and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Reserach (CFIR) to code our PSD Development Process

We are just getting started on our CFIR coding branch https://github.com/LZIM/teampsd/tree/cfir_coding
For more information about using the CFIR please go to http://cfirguide.org/

## Our facilitation_guide branch now has 4 learning loop exercises 

* Building Shared Vision
* Graphs Over Time 
* Eliciting Causal Loop Diagrams 
* Ratio Exercise

These exercises are adapted from https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Scriptapedia
More work to turn this into Facilitation Guide resources is ongoing https://github.com/LZIM/teampsd/tree/facilitation_guide

* Our first team issue was developing our style sheets for formatting consistency when using rMarkdown.

We are still working on that...

But, we have added several resources that we are using to create a consistent "loook and feel" for Team PSD resources that is consistent with the VHA Graphics and Style reporting requirements.

These resources are growing here: https://github.com/LZIM/teampsd/tree/hexagon_icons

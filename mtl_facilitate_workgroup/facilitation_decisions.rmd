2. It helps to bullet the findings, it makes it easier for learners  

3. Keep an eye on recording and moving the team toward higher level systems thinking in the FINDINGS text box, not just the HYPOTHESIS text box.  

4. Dimesions of Systems Thinking (codebook):  
a. multivariable complexity of relationship  
b. closing feedback loops  
c. system behavior over time (description of output linked to system causes)  
d. more nuanced understanding of time (e.g., worse before better, short-run, long run)  

5. Approved description of AGG service proportions: Of patients who engage with the team in a given service, these are the proportions of patients with at least one visit with the primary diagnosis shown.  Patients with a given diagnosis may engage in multiple services, and patients in a given service may be seen for different primary diagnoses.  Therefore, percentages may sum to more than one in both rows and columns. (pct)   

	
**FACILITATION DECISIONS TO FINALIZE**

- [NEED TO TEST/PREP in 1.52 to see the new functions for pulling up old text and for reading in the last experiment runs, new functions for saving runs]

1. Compare Services does not show results when you're only looking at previous runs. After RUN and SAVE for the current run it does.

2. If you start a session showing what you did last time by copying the text from last time in to a fresh run (reset) - BECAUSE - you lose any text that you workshop if you revise the text, and haven't reset, but then need to reset for a new run.

Re-cap decisions this week

1. plural/time (patients/week or pts/wk) with the one exception for units of appointments, which is plural in word form, and singular in standard abbreviation for unit form "appt"

2. file names "yyyy_mm_dd_hhmm" (all lower case)

3. Stripped for rates any reference to module "ending rate" not "ending CC rate" for flows, but for units in stocks we'll keep the module detail (appointments in CC, patients in CC). - ***THE EXCEPTION IS AGG, where you need to pull up the rates by service.***

The column labeled "Standard" is the Standard definition for that variable. If the variable in the same row in your MTL resource is purple, then it means you need to update your resource to make it consistent with the standard.

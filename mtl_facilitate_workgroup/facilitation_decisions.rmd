2. It helps to bullet the findings, it makes it easier for learners  

3. Keep an eye on recording and moving the team toward higher level systems thinking in the FINDINGS text box, not just the HYPOTHESIS text box.  

4 Dimesions of Systems Thinking (codebook):  

a. multivariable complexity of relationship  

b. closing feedback loops  

c. system behavior over time (description of output linked to system causes)  

d. more nuanced understanding of time (e.g., worse before better, short-run, long run)  

8. Approved description of AGG service proportions: Of patients who engage with the team in a given service, these are the proportions of patients with at least one visit with the primary diagnosis shown.  Patients with a given diagnosis may engage in multiple services, and patients in a given service may be seen for different primary diagnoses.  Therefore, percentages may sum to more than one in both rows and columns. (pct)

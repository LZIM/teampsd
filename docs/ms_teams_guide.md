## Additional Tips/Functions

### VA Teams WebApp Browser

Click on the Teams WebApp shortcut on your CITRIX remote log-in desktop to access the browser version as CITRIX does not have the desktop version installed.

If you do not see the WebApp shortcut, open Google Chrome and type in **teams.microsoft.com** to access it manually.

![browser tab image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/92042262-b0e07500-ed2e-11ea-8de0-04742fd721e6.png)

### Meet in a Channel

To know where a meeting call is being held in a channel:

Look to see the **purple video icon** next to a **channel's name**.

Drag your cursor over to an existing comment and **click on the 3 dots** next to the 6 "react" emojis.

![three dots reply image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/88048159-ad3eb900-cb07-11ea-9909-bdee742f6e72.png)

### Type in Markdown

Teams is Markdown friendly!

Try using **basic markdown** such as bolding or italicizing text in a comment/reply.

![bold sentence example image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/88048320-fa228f80-cb07-11ea-940e-e11212b8b93e.png)

### Start a Call in a Thread

To start a meeting call within the same conversation thread to keep context:

In the conversation thread, click on the **reply button**.

![reply button image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/88048378-10305000-cb08-11ea-921d-b31fb86e5b7b.png)

Click on the **video icon button** to begin a call.

![video icon image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/88048451-33f39600-cb08-11ea-8082-dddbf10ac0c4.png)

### Record a Meeting

To record a meeting or call:

Within the meeting/call, click on the **3 dots [...]** in the middle navigation bar and select **"Start recording".**

![start recording button image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/94718500-aa7df280-0306-11eb-9b97-9dbda5179f0d.png)

The following will occur to indicate that you are recording:

- A **disclaimer will pop-up** at the top of the meeting for everyone.
- A **red circle** will appear next to the meeting timer in the navigation bar.

![disclaimer image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/94718591-c97c8480-0306-11eb-82e7-e0d6b666ba72.png)

When you are done with the meeting/call, click on the **3 dots [...]** in the middle navigation bar and select **"Stop recording".**

![stop recording image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/94718760-09436c00-0307-11eb-8c47-6add60624f8f.png)

The recording will need time to upload and render (e.g 50 min recording took about 2-3 min). Once finished, the **video will automatically populate** in the meeting's **Chat thread**.

![recording being saved message image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/94719168-abfbea80-0307-11eb-8199-26767066f213.png)

![meeting saved icon in discussion thread image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/94719339-e8c7e180-0307-11eb-8cff-292fee0d789b.png)

### Share Dual Screens

To share multiple browser windows or screens:

Click on the **screen share button** that appears when you hover over your meeting call screen:

![screen share button image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/89902987-f8df0280-db9b-11ea-80de-d959acf7ec54.png)

Select the **square underneath Desktop** to share your entire laptop's Desktop screen.

Note: Be wary of any open tabs or browsers you may have open that may contain PHI or personal information that you do not want to share.

![share screen selection image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/89903248-4b202380-db9c-11ea-8072-e0a5c698fc90.png)

You will notice a subtle red border outlining your entire desktop screen. The red border is only visible to you and not anyone else, hence not pictured here.

TIP: Queue up the window you want to share in advance. I had already queued up my Google Chrome Browser in the background, which is now being shared as the default of entire desktop screen.

![browser image of queued page image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/89903438-7c98ef00-db9c-11ea-97f0-1958311c870f.png)

Drag in other window/browsers within the red border to show dual screens.

Here I am showing Google Chrome and Teams:

![google chrome page in and teams image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/89903549-a225f880-db9c-11ea-9ceb-cd620b54a5f5.png)

End screen sharing by going back to the meeting and clicking on the screen sharing button.

![stop sharing icon image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/89903641-bff35d80-db9c-11ea-97b0-8f64fe0f96a0.png)

### Disappeared Meeting

To find a meeting call's screen once you've clicked out of the meeting to look elsewhere on Teams (i.e you needed to respond to a ping, when to look for a link in a discussion thread, etc.):

Minimize the Teams browser completely by clicking on the middle (-) button at the top header of the browser:

![minimize button image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/89908115-5d04c500-dba2-11ea-9760-4f4ccb648232.png)

Go to a new browser or your desktop and the meeting call should appear in the bottom right hand corner:

![google image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59668647/89908479-c5ec3d00-dba2-11ea-80d7-fcf6537c7691.png)

Alternative (only applicable to Channel Meetings, not Private 1:1 meetings):

If you remember which Channel the meeting call was in, you can click back into the meeting by 'Joining' in again, this will not show you joining twice as you are just re-joining.

### "React" to a Comment

To "React" to a comment or reply to acknowledge it:

Drag your cursor over to an existing comment and **select 1 of the 6 emojis** to "react" to it.

### Link a Comment/Discussion/File

Drag your cursor over to an existing comment and **click on the 3 dots** next to the 6 "react" emojis.

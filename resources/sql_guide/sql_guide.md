## 1. What is Microsoft SQL Server

MTL team uses the **Microsoft SQL Server DBMS (Database Management System)** as well as the **SQL (Structured Query Language)** to work with data. As such, a fundamental understanding of SQL Server and SQL is helpful.

Microsoft SQL Server is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applications, which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network.


## 2. SQL Server Structure in a Nutshell

A **Schema** in a SQL database is a collection of logical structures of data. The schema is owned by a database user and has the same name as the database user. From SQL Server 2005, a schema is an independent entity (container of objects) different from the user who creates that object.

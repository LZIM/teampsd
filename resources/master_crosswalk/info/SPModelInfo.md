| SP | GMH Care Quality                                                                   | GMH Care Quality                                                       | Quality care has many   dimensions, but in this model we are mainly concerned with how quality   impacts the time it takes patients' symptoms to improve; specifically   impacting the variables "Time to Improve" and "Time to   Unflag."  A shorter time implies   faster recovery.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| SP | GMH Community Care Patients Reduce Effort                                          | GMH Community Care Patients Reduce Effort                              | Patients seen in the community take less effort than a typical   patient, but not zero effort.  We   estimate that 5 patients seen in the community take the same effort as one   patient in care in VA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| SP | GMH Effect of Patient Load on Ability to Detect Symptom   Changes                  | GMH Effect of Patient Load on Ability to Detect Symptom   Changes      | As workload increases, the ability of providers to detect   symptom changes decreases, and vice versa.    This effect directly impacts the variable "Time to   Detect."  This effect is limited   to 3x, as the highest load could not do more than triple the original Time to   Detect.  There is no limit to the   positive effect decreasing workload has on providers' ability to detect   symptom changes.                                                                                                   |
| SP | GMH Effect of Patient Load on Care Quality                                         | GMH Effect of Patient Load on Care Quality                             | As workload increases, the quality of care provided by a team   decreases, and vice versa.  This effect   is limited to 2x, as even the lowest workload could no more than double the   original quality of care (i.e., no more than halve the current Time to   Improve and the Time to Unflag). There is no limit to the detremental effect   increasing workload has on care quality, and could (potentially) drive   "Time to Improve" and "Time to UnFlag" toward infinity.                                   |
| SP | GMH Effect of Patient Load on Manageable Total Patients                            | GMH Effect of Patient Load on Manageable Total Patients                | If workload experiences a sustained increase, eventually the   total patients the setting can manage decreases, due to provider fatigue and   burnout.  This effect seeks to   represent both small changes (providers taking more sick days) and large   changes (providers quitting entirely) in supply.  The effect can only go below 1, as   below-average workload cannot increase supply.                                                                                                                    |
| SP | GMH Effect of Patient Load on Start Rate                                           | GMH Effect of Patient Load on Start Rate                               | As workload increases, the ability of providers to start new   patients decreases, and vice versa.    This effect directly impacts the "Patient Start Rate."  This effect seeks to represent the physical   reality of having a schedule that is too full to start new patients.   There is no limit to the detremental   effect increasing workload has on start rate -- a high-enough workload could   cut patient starts to zero.                                                                               |
| SP | GMH Effect of PC/PCMHI Wait Time on Recommend Step down Rate                       | GMH Effect of PC/PCMHI Wait Time on Recommend Step down Rate           | As wait times to step down to PC/PCMHI increase (both for GMH   patients who transfer and those who start in PC/PCMHI withouth leaving GMH),   GMH providers will be less willing to recommend that their patients step   down.  There is no limit to the   detremental effect PC/PCMHI wait times have on GMH step down recommendations;   however, this effect is limited to a maximum of 1.5x, as very low wait times   could increase step down recommendations by no more than 50% over the   original rate.  |
| SP | GMH Effect of SMH Wait Time on Recommend Step up Rate                              | GMH Effect of SMH Wait Time on Recommend Step up Rate                  | As wait times to step up to SMH increase (both for GMH   patients who transfer and those who start in SMH withouth leaving GMH), GMH   providers will be less willing to recommend that their patients step up.  There is no limit to the detremental effect   SMH wait times have on GMH step up recommendations; however, this effect is   limited to a maximum of 1.5x, as very low wait times could increase step up   recommendations by no more than 50% over the original rate.                             |
| SP | GMH Effect of Wait Time on Start Rate                                              | GMH Effect of Wait Time on Start Rate                                  | As wait times into GMH increase, GMH providers will feel more   pressure to start new patients.  This   effect is limited to 2x, as even the highest increase in wait times could   only double the original patient start rate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

We estimate that seeing  one patient with a High Risk Flag takes the   same effort as providing care for two average patients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| SP | SMH Effect of Patient Load on Ability to Detect Symptom   Changes                  | SMH Effect of Patient Load on Ability to Detect Symptom   Changes      | As wait times to step down to GMH increase (both for SMH   patients who transfer and those who start in GMH without leaving SMH), SMH   providers will be less willing to recommend that their patients step   down.  There is no limit to the   detremental effect GMH wait times have on SMH step down recommendations;   however, this effect is limited to a maximum of 1.5x, as very low wait times   could increase step down recommendations by no more than 50% over the   original rate.                  |

This effect directly impacts the variable "Time to   Detect."  This effect is limited   to 3x, as the highest load could not do more than triple the original Time to   Detect.

This effect   is limited to 2x, as even the lowest workload could no more than double the   original quality of care (i.e., no more than halve the current Time to   Improve and the Time to Unflag). There is no limit to the detremental effect   increasing workload has on care quality, and could (potentially) drive   "Time to Improve" and "Time to UnFlag" toward infinity.                                   |

This effect seeks to   represent both small changes (providers taking more sick days) and large   changes (providers quitting entirely) in supply.  The effect can only go below 1, as   below-average workload cannot increase supply.                                                                                                                    |

This effect directly impacts the "Patient Start Rate."  This effect seeks to represent the physical   reality of having a schedule that is too full to start new patients.   There is no limit to the detremental   effect increasing workload has on start rate -- a high-enough workload could   cut patient starts to zero.                                                                               |

| Median Engagement                                 | The median number of weeks that patients stay engaged with the team, receiving care coordination visits according to team data. The visits can be with any member of the team.  This engagement time represents a patient's entire engagement in care coordination across treatment episodes, regardless of gaps in service. (wks)                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Appointment Supply (75th percentile)              | An estimate of the weekly number of care coordination appointments available with this team. The estimate is calculated using the volume of care coordination visits completed with the team over one year.

| New Patient Wait Time (median)                    | An estimate of new patient wait time between their first care coordination appointment being scheduled and that visit being completed with this team.  (wks)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Actual RVI                                        | By Little's Law, the average time between appointments for existing patients is the quotient of the number of appointments and the rate at which they are completed.  If there is more demand for completing appointments than there is available capacity, then actual return visit interval will increase, even if the desired RVI doesn't change.  If the completing appointment rate drops to zero, then the wait is technically infinite. In the model, appointments are never cancelled due to high wait times, but for ease of display, Actual RVI is capped at 12 months (52 weeks) and is also constrained from going to zero as the number of appointments approaches zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Appointments for Existing Patients                | Appointments for current patients consume appointment supply. The number of appointments used each week is the lesser of the existing patient demand (based on the number of appointments booked and the desired return visit interval) or the supply of available appointments per week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Booking Rate                                      | The booking appointment rate depends on the number of existing patients seen by the team (i.e., the quotent of the total patients in care and their average return visit interval) and the number of new patients booked each week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Completing Rate                                   | The rate at which appointments are completed is the lesser of the existing patient demand for care (driven by the number of booked appointments and the revisit interval) or current supply of appointments per week.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Effect of Task Time on Missed Appointments        | The deviation from the the base case missed appointment rate is controlled by an exponent that reflects how sensitive both patients and providers are to provider fatigue. The negative sign on the exponent indicates that this is inversely coded, i.e., decreasing time for other CC tasks (e.g., appointment prep, follow-up, reminder calls) increases the missed appointment rate. Patients start to experience this reduced quality by their next appointment, which occurs after the teams actual return visit interval. The effect is restricted from going below 1, as lower than official work hours do not influence providers or patients to come more regularly to their appointments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Effect of Wait Time on Referrals                  | The effect wait time has on referral rates, applied to potenital patients to CC specific to their primary diagnosis. The deviation from the target delivery delay is adjusted by an exponent that reflects how sensitive providers' triage decisions are to these deviations. The negative sign on the exponent indicates that this is inversely coded, i.e., attractiveness drops as care delay increases. It is constrained from going above 1 (our assumption is that lower than expected new patient wait times do not increase referrals).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Ending Rate                                       | The number of patients finishing the service is a function the number of patients in treatment and their median time in treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Measured versus Actual Time                       | This represents the relative change in time available for other Care Coordination (CC) or CC-related tasks consumed by overbooking patient visits. We assume that these "extra" appointments come at the expense of "other CC related tasks," such as , team coordination, patient reminder calls, chart review and other appointment prep, etc. It is constrained from going to zero, even if official appointment supply is zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| New Patient Wait Time                             | By Little's Law, the average wait time for new patients is the quotient of the number of patients waiting and the rate at which they start service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Patients in CC                                    | Total number of patients in treatment, initial value set 1, to show how the clinic fills up as the model comes to equilibrium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Referral Rate                                     | The number of referrals is currently unmeasurable, and is thus endogeneously generated to maintain the new patient wait time (either as measured from the team's data, or using their desired new patient wait time) during initialization.  After week 0, that base referral rate is held, but can be affected by both the "Effect of Wait Time on Referrals" and any user experiments with additional referrals. This allows the user to observe relative changes in the new patient wait time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Rescheduling Rate                                 | The rescheduling rate depends on the total number of appointments to reschedule and the average time it takes to reschedule them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

The user can also set the start rate to instead be based on the team's data, which can be helpful in assessing the supply and RVI needed to meet their real-world demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| True Missed Appointment Rate                      | The number of appointments that must be re-scheduled, as either the clinician or the patient missed the appointment.  These missed appointments are affected by the baseline rate and changes in the time the team allocates to non-patient-facing care.

| Waiting to Start                                  | Total number of patients waiting to start the service, initial value set to provide the desired wait time in equilibrium.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Use Team Data for Starting Rate                   | Switch controling if the number of new patient starts per week is based on either a) the remaining appointment supply after all existing patients are seen, or b) the average new patient start rate estimated from the team's data, which can be helpful in assessing the supply and RVI needed to meet the team's real-world demand. The default is set to ignore the team's average patient start rate, and instead continually match patient starts to available appointment capacity.  "Off" = if all existing patients can be seen at the desired RVI, then only start new patients in the remaining appointment slots. "On" = start new patients based on the team's average rate, even if there won't be enough supply to see existing patients at the desired RVI.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| User-defined Appointment Supply                   | The number of official appointments offered each week.  This value replaces the default value estimated from the team's data, with the assumption that any increase in supply comes from reducing appointments offered in other services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Additional Appointment Supply for New CC Patients | The number of additional appointments offered each week to new patients, with the assumption that the team currently has no such carve-outs.

This value replaces the default value, which was calculated to ensure the team only receives as many referrals as they could start while maintaining the desired new patient wait time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Sensitivity of Missed Appointments to Task Time   | The effect size of changes in relative time available for other Care Coordination tasks on the likilihood of patients or providers missing an appointment. A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between overbooks and missed appointments. A value below 1 indicates that patients are not sensitive to small changes in other CC task time; an exponent greater than 1 indicates that patients are very sensitive to small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20% more hours per week than their official supply, then an exponent of "1" would indicate that the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20% higher than the base case. A value of 0.5 would cause that same 20% increase in hours worked would only cause a 9.5% increase in the missed appointment ratio.  A value of 2 would cause that 20% increase to increase the missed appointment rate by 44% over the base case. |
| Sensitivity of Referrals to Wait Time             | The effect size of changes in new patient wait time on service attractiveness and referrals, where referrals drop as wait time increases. A value of "1" implies the assumption that a doubling of the new patient wait time (relative to the new patient wait time goal) will cut the referral rate in half.  For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would reduce the referral rate to 71% of its original value, and a value of "1.5" would reduce the referral rate to 35%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

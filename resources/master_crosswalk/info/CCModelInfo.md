| Actual RVI                                        | The actual average return to clinic interval the team maintains.  This is either the same as the RVI used when appointments are scheduled, or longer, if there is more demand (based on appointments on the calendar and the target RVI) than supply (based on the Appointment Supply).   Appointments are never cancelled due to high wait times, but actual RVI is capped at 12 months (52 weeks) for ease of display.  (wks)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Appointments for Existing Patients                | The number of appointments used by existing patients each week.  The team either satisfies all the demand from existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) or uses all the supply (based on the Appointment Supply), leaving no appointments available for new patients.  (appt/wk)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Completing Rate                                   | Appointment completions are based on the team either satisfying all the demand from existing patients (based on appointments on the calendar and the scheduled RVI) or using all the supply (based on the Appointment Supply).  If there is more demand than supply, then not all scheduled appointments will be seen in a timely manner, and Actual RVI will increase.  This is different from a completed visit, as the appointment is still complete even if the patient no-shows.   (appt/wk)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Effect of Task Time on Missed Appointments        | When the team uses overtime, they have less time available for important, but non-patient-facing care tasks  (e.g., appointment prep, charting, follow-up, reminder calls).  The more overtime a team works, the greater this effect, and the more the missed appointment rate will increase, compared to the norm.  This effect only applies to overtime: working lower than the official work hours does not influence providers or patients to come more regularly to their appointments.

| Effect of Wait Time on Referrals                  | When the wait time to start care coordination increases above the target wait time, referring providers will be less likely to refer a new patient.  This effect only applies to above-target wait times:  lower than expected new patient wait times do not increase referrals above the norm.

| Sensitivity of Missed Appointments to Task Time   | This controls the magnitude of the effect changes in time for non-patient-facing care tasks has on missed appointments.  A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between overbooks and missed appointments. A value below 1 indicates that patients are not sensitive to small changes in non-patient-facing task time; a value greater than 1 indicates that patients are very sensitive to small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20% more hours per week than their official supply, then an exponent of "1" would indicate that the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20% higher than before. A value of "0.5" would cause that same 20% increase in hours worked to have less of an effect (causing only a 9.5% increase in the missed appointment percentage).  A value of "2" would cause that same 20% increase to have a greater effect (raising the missed appointment percentage by 44%). |
| Sensitivity of Referrals to Wait Time             | This controls the magnitude of the effect increases in new patient wait time (or decreases in target wait time) have on referrals, where referrals drop as wait time increases (or the target wait time decreases).  A value of "zero" implies that there is no relationship between wait time and referrals.  A value of "1" indicates that if  the new patient wait time doubles (relative to the new patient wait time goal), then referring providers will cut their care coordination referrals in half.  For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would result in less of an effect (reducing the referral rate to 71% of its original value), and a value of "1.5" would result in a greater effect (reducing the referral rate to less than 35% of its original value).                                                                                                                                                                             |

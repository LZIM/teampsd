| MM |  Effect of "Other   MM Tasks Time" on Missed Appointments                             | Effect of Task Time on Missed Appointments      |  When the team uses   overtime, they have less time available for important, but non-patient-facing   care tasks  (e.g., appointment prep,   charting, follow-up, reminder calls).    The more overtime a team works, the greater this effect, and the more   the missed appointment rate will increase, compared to the norm.  This effect only applies to overtime: working   lower than the official work hours does not influence providers or patients   to come more regularly to their appointments.

This   effect only applies to above-target wait times:  lower than expected new patient wait times   do not increase referrals above the norm.

Additional appointments overbooked onto the   schedule come directly at the expense of these tasks.

| MM |  Sensitivity of Changes   in Other MM Tasks Time on Missed Appointments               | Sensitivity of Missed Appointments to Task Time |  This controls the   magnitude of the effect changes in time for non-patient-facing care tasks has   on missed appointments.  A value of   "zero" implies that there is no relationship between overbooks and   missed appointments. A value below 1 indicates that patients are not   sensitive to small changes in non-patient-facing task time; a value greater   than 1 indicates that patients are very sensitive to small changes. Example: if   a team is putting in 20% more hours per week than their official supply, then   an exponent of "1" would indicate that the ratio of missed   appointments to all appointments would also be 20% higher than before. A   value of "0.5" would cause that same 20% increase in hours worked   to have less of an effect (causing only a 9.5% increase in the missed   appointment percentage).  A value of   "2" would cause that same 20% increase to have a greater effect   (raising the missed appointment percentage by 44%).  |
| MM |  Sensitivity of   Referrals to Wait Times                                             | Sensitivity of Referrals to Wait Times          |  This controls the   magnitude of the effect increases in new patient wait time (or decreases in   target wait time) have on referrals, where referrals drop as wait time   increases (or the target wait time decreases).  A value of "zero" implies that   there is no relationship between wait time and referrals.  A value of "1" indicates that   if  the new patient wait time doubles   (relative to the new patient wait time goal), then referring providers will   cut their care coordination referrals in half.  For the same situation, a value of   "0.5" would result in less of an effect (reducing the referral rate   to 71% of its original value), and a value of "1.5" would result in   a greater effect (reducing the referral rate to less than 35% of its original   value).                                                                                                                                                                                   |

These values replaces the base case   value, which is calculated from the team's data. Any set of percentages is   possible, but they must sum to 1. For providers without X-Waivers, they   should not allocate any time to OUD treatment, thus the value for the third %   should always be zero.

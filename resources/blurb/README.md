Team PSD, or Team Participatory System Dynamics, is a multidisciplinary team of scientists led by Dr. Lindsey Zimmerman, a clinical and community psychologist, and implementation scientist at the National Center for PTSD. Team PSD works in partnership with VA patients, providers, and policy-makers to increase Veterans' access to timely, high-quality addiction and mental health care. Over the last few years, Team PSD developed *Modeling to Learn (MTL)* a national program designed to empower frontline teams of providers to use systems science and simulation to improve local care quality with existing local resources. Team PSD aims for equitable use of *MTL* resources and follows principles of the open science movement, including free, transparent, reproducible *Modeling to Learn* resources available on GitHub at [mtl.how](mtl.how). You can go to [mtl.how](mtl.how), and download *MTL* models of care coordination, medication management, psychotherapy, aggregrate team services, and measurement based stepped care for suicide prevention. You can also access download session guides for facilitating teams in answering their own questions, by testing dynamic hyopothesis about key local priorities, and incorporating greater systems thinking in shared clinical decisions. *Modeling to Learn* includes accessible tools for transparent review of local team data and real-time simulation mutual learning activities to help teams of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, certified peer support specialists and other frontline providers to better meet the needs of Veterans in their communities.

# TeamPSD GitHub Style Guide for Level 1-5 Headers Across All TeamPSD Documentation
1. Checklist for how to review existing resources to conform to a consistent TeamPSD style and standard use of Markdown for the manual.
2. Define Level 1-5 headers in a standard way across all TeamPSD documents.
3. YAML will be removed when knitted and Level 1 Header needs to be the first item in each of the documents.

## Style
1. General Markdown syntax [guide](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf).
2. Other style guidelines on TeamPSD materials. 

## Reviewing & Editing TeamPSD Documents
- [ ] Open up the specific **document file** you want to edit.  
- [ ] Create a **new working branch** and name it using all lowercase, no spaces (use underscores) and your initials.
- [ ] Follow the **checklist** below to edit the **level 1-5 headers** in the document.

- [ ] If the document is **missing a YAML header** be sure to **insert** one at the **top of the document** using the YAML code [here].(https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/rita_2020_04_27_issue_1364/resources/bookdown/sample_header_user.md) you can copy the exact code from the top of the document

- [ ] If the document is **Has a YAML header** be sure to **update** the **date section** with current date and your initials **RH April 29 2020**.
- [ ] Ensure the document has a **title** using **header 1** - by adding the **markdown code** before the title **#** use case [example](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/edit/master/resources/training_guides/github/repositories.md).  
- [ ] Each **section** within a document needs **section headings** to facilitate reading, for section headings add the **markdown code** before the subheading title **##** and **add additional ##** for increasingly smaller header section.
- [ ] Once the document has been edited to be **consistent** in **style** follow the steps for a **pull request** to update the document. 


### Making a Pull Requests
- [ ] Go to **pull requests** and  make a **new pull request** and **assign** a reviewer. 
- [ ] Cross reference the **pull request** with the **task issue card** that refers to the TeamPSD documentation being edited.

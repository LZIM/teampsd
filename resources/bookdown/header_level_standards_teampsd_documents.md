# TeamPSD GitHub Guide for Level 1-5 headers 
1. Checklist for how to review existing resources to conform to a consistent TeamPSD style and standard use of Markdown for the manual
2. Define Level 1-5 headers in a standard way
3. YAML will be removed when knitted and Level 1 Header needs to be the first item in each of the documents

### **Style**
1. We use R Markdown format for syntax and style for all TeamPSD documents - [guide available](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).  
2. The style and content within TeamPSD documents accomodates for human and computer readable format to name files, meaning all lowercase, underscores, and dates (as necesary) with a name that will be meaningful to whoever reads it. 
3. Other style guidelines on TeamPSD materials

# Header Style Guide for Team PSD Documents

## Details of Style Guide
- Visual example of style guide document [here](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/tree/master/resources/bookdown) 
- Visual example of YAML and Headers document [here](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/bookdown/sample_header_user.md) 
- Example of well formated document [here](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/mtl_facilitate_workgroup/checklists/pre_meeting_checklist.md) has clear strcuture, hierarchy and helps the reader to navigate the content, and see at first glance the overall objective of the document.
- Example of a well structured document [here](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/tree/master/resources/listening) but lacking a YAML header and consistent formating  
- Example of badly formated document [here](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/resources/maps/maps_markdown/documentation_map.md) no YAML header, no clear guidance when document was created or by whom, the file has an image, but there's no accompanying text or explanation for the purpose of the document and [here](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/sim_ui_workgroup/sim_ui_diagram_files/README.Rmd) file has not clear purpose or objective.

**Header Style Guide in See & Say Guides** | **Header Style Guide in Other Team PSD Documents** | **Rationale **
-- | -- | --
YAML headers | Every document | Essential to keep track of when a document was created, by whom and revisions to a document were made
H1 (#) used for session title and ”Today we modeling to learn...”: line | Document Title | Document needs a title to orient reader, only one title per document, or major section of a larger document
H2 (##) used for Done/Do, which is also in a table. Icons in the table will be height = "75" width = "110, links, etc. | Subheadings | Section headers are helpful to truncate information within a document, it helps the reader to see the main areas the document aims to cover.
H2 (##) used for Learning Objectives, with icon. | Subsections | A document may have more than one H2 header, as there may be multiple sections within a document.
H1 (#) used for In-Session Exercise | Add additional titles for longer documents | A larger document may need more than one H1 header, especially if it helps to break up a long document.  The suggestion for a H1 header is when the content of the document differs significantly from the H2 subsection header and avoids confusion for the reader.
H3 (###) is for numbered steps. | Numbered steps in a checklist or action items. | Sections within a document may include a range of numbered steps that benefit by being organized into H3 headers, to be distinguished from other text.
H4 (####) is for “New for _MTL 2.0,” etc. | Use for general text you want to emphasize a section of text | A H4 header, is visually identical to **bolding** within a document , but may be useful when the entire section should stand out for the main text and **bolding** is impractical.

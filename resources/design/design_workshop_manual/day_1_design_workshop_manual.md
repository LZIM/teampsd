# TeamPSD Design Workshop Manual

## Day 1: Design Thinking
Design Thinking - Team PSD Manual (and all that it includes):

- Using Good UX (user-experience) Design...
- The Sciences of the Artificial, Herbert Simon
- Hasso-Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford (d.school).
- Using resources from the non-profit Interaction Design foundation (interaction-design.org)

### 1. **Empathize** - To gain an empathic understanding of the need or problem you are trying to solve in terms of people, **processes** that set aside individual **assumptions** to get insight into the need.

- **What?** Details of what to do (what happened).
   - This is when we **analyze** observe and document details that relate to
users.
- **How?** How the person does it (effort, etc.)
- **Why?** Motivations/purpose (test this out...)

**Exercises for assumptions** (remember: everything is a perspective):

a. **List assumptions**

b. **Ask**: How could this not be true?

c. **Ask**: What if we could do this twice as well in half the time?


### 2. **Define the problem** - This is when we **synthesize** observations into holistic **point of view** (POV). **Goal is to make linkages, so that we define the right problem to address.**

[Example POV: Busy, nationally distributed, cross-functional team of scientists has many partners, is about to hire more people, leads a national participatory system dynamics simulation learning program in, and is gaining increasing national and international interest in partnership HMW...]

2a.	**A problem statement: Focuses on**

- **Specific peopleʼs needs** (not the technology or specs),
- **Value and insights for the project** (not the technical requirements), yet it is...
- ...narrow enough to be **managed within our constraints**

**Exercises for definitions with how-why/why-how laddering** (a variant of **5 whys** principle):

a. Asking **"Why?"** Explores to understand **root causes** (abstract, more common across people)

b. ...then **“How might we?”** to get to a **specific** problem/challenge we can solve (concrete)

**Part I - The HMW Brainstorm...HMW**

- use the efficiency of GitHub [good]
- remove the [bad] steep learning curve
- integrate with existing GH norms the best part [explore the opposite]
- remove reliance on training [question the assumption]
- go after adjectives [make it easy, instead of hard]
- use code instead of by hand [leverage unexpected resource]
- enable self-directed learning like “Googling” [analogy from need/context]
- attract help from Forio, MITRE, VA to solve this [shift POV against the challenge]
- get it up and running now [shift a status quo]
- divvy up chunks for each workgroup [break up POV]
 
**Part II**

1. “**Why** do we need to integrate our manuals, workflows and processes on GitHub to achieve Team PSD values? (if start with Why, phrase as a need and make it meaningful.”

Because...

2. “**How** do we use manuals, workflows and process on GitHub now?”

- [describe]
- **"Why?"**
- **“Why?”**

3. What what was most **surprising**?
4. What would we have **missed** if we hadnʼt asked why?

### 3. **Ideate** - Expand the problem space by identifying and testing out elements that would circumvent problems.
- time-limit
- quantity over quality
- no distractions
- no bad ideas

**Part I.**

**SCAMPER** - Review our **existing** Team PSD workgroups/workflow (SOP), platform & processes, resources and review them through seven **lenses**.

- **Substitute** to improve - Can I substitute (replace) people, rules, names, processes?
- **Combine** to achieve something different - Can I merge, maximize...?
- **Adapt** to solve it - Which part could change? Which context could change?
- **Modify** (Magnify and Minify) - Can emphasize, add, grow, tone down...?
- **Put to another use** - Could X, Y, Z person use it? Who else? How else could it be used?
- **Eliminate** - What would happen if we trim, narrow, reduce, effort, time, costs, rules? I can eliminate X by...
- **Reverse** (rearrange) - What if this process was reverse? Could we change the schedule or pace?

**Do any answers stand out as viable solutions?**

**Part II.**

**Worst possible idea.**

1. Come up with as many bad ideas as we can.
2. List all the properties of the bad ideas.
3. List what is it that makes these ideas bad.
4. Search for the opposite of the worst attribute.
5. Mix/match and substitute bad ideas to see what happens.

**Part III.**

**Exercises using Personas** to distill essences of each [Team PSD Manual] user type, who they are and what they do with the relevant resources in relevant contexts. **The goal mapping usersʼ needs to design functionality**.

- Based on **observation** of real users.
- Shaped iteratively by defining **needs** AND **users**.
- **Context**: How will this help in context?
- **Goal**: Goal-directed personaʼs enable good tests.
- **Role**: Role-directed perspective.
- **Hypothesis**:
- **Description**: values, interests, education, needs, attitudes, desires, limitations, goals
- **Situations/scenarios**: put the user in contexts with problems to overcome.

**Key idea is to avoid designing for yourself only, or designing and forcing generic users to fit the design.**

1. Stay in context: How will a team member use it during typical Team PSD day?
2. Reflect real behaviors: What does a Team PSD member have to do?
3. Has an end goal: What does a Team PSD member want to achieve?
4. Addresses a pain point: What is the hardest/most frustrating aspect of the situation/context?

### 4. **Prototype** - inexpensive, scaled down version with the **key features** to investigate the problem and solution. **Goal is to identify the best possible solution**.
- Solutions are investigated, accepted, improved, re-examined, rejected based on user-experiences.
- Should give much better sense sense of constraints and how users would behave, think, and feels when interaction with it.

### 5. **Test** - test your prototype with the personas in question.
- Does the prototype address the personas needs and pain points?

## Week 3: Review User Results of MVP

In week 3, we want to share our MVPs with the user to collect user feedback.

To collect feedback, users will be participating in 2 Think Aloud protocols: **Concurrent Screencast Video (no audio) and Retrospective Verbal.**

1.  **A Concurrent Screencast Video Think Aloud** requires users to screencast themselves going through the MVP prototype, but without audio so they can focus soley on using the MVP.
2.  **A Retrospective Verbal Think Aloud** occurs after the Concurrent Screencase Video Think Aloud in which users think about how they felt about the MVP, what went wrong, what went right, what was missing, etc and write it up afterwards.

These 2 Think Aloud protocols allows us to leverage both the pros and cons of a Concurrent and Retrospective Think Aloud in which:

- the Concurrent provides an undisturbed recording of the user going through the MVP.
- the Retrospective allows the users to verbalize their thoughts, emotions, and feelings about the MVP.

*Week 3 follows the **3rd and 4th phases of the process for design thinking** which involves the ability to **ideate** MVPs
based on the needs and assumptions of the users and get user feedback on a **prototype** MVP that will solve 80% of the user's 
pain points and needs with only 20% effort.*

3. **Ideate** - Expand the problem space by identifying and testing out elements that would circumvent problems.

- time-limit
- quantity over quality
- no distractions
- no bad ideas

**Exercises to think through when reviewing the user persona CTA & RTAs:**

**Part I.**

**SCAMPER** - Review our **existing** Team PSD workgroups/workflow (SOP), platform & processes, resources and review them through seven **lenses**.

- **Substitute** to improve - Can I substitute (replace) people, rules, names, processes?
- **Combine** to achieve something different - Can I merge, maximize...?
- **Adapt** to solve it - Which part could change? Which context could change?
- **Modify** (Magnify and Minify) - Can emphasize, add, grow, tone down...?
- **Put to another use** - Could X, Y, Z person use it? Who else? How else could it be used?
- **Eliminate** - What would happen if we trim, narrow, reduce, effort, time, costs, rules? I can eliminate X by...
- **Reverse** (rearrange) - What if this process was reverse? Could we change the schedule or pace?

**Do any answers stand out as viable solutions?**

**Part II.**

**Worst possible idea.**

1. Come up with as many bad ideas as we can.
2. List all the properties of the bad ideas.
3. List what is it that makes these ideas bad.
4. Search for the opposite of the worst attribute.
5. Mix/match and substitute bad ideas to see what happens.

**Part III.**

**Exercises using Personas** to distill essences of each [Team PSD Manual] user type, who they are and what they do with the relevant resources in relevant contexts. **The goal mapping usersʼ needs to design functionality**.

- Based on **observation** of real users.
- Shaped iteratively by defining **needs** AND **users**.
- **Context**: How will this help in context?
- **Goal**: Goal-directed personaʼs enable good tests.
- **Role**: Role-directed perspective.
- **Hypothesis**:
- **Description**: values, interests, education, needs, attitudes, desires, limitations, goals
- **Situations/scenarios**: put the user in contexts with problems to overcome.

**Key idea is to avoid designing for yourself only, or designing and forcing generic users to fit the design.**

- Stay in context: How will a team member use it during typical Team PSD day?
- Reflect real behaviors: What does a Team PSD member have to do?
- Has an end goal: What does a Team PSD member want to achieve?
- Addresses a pain point: What is the hardest/most frustrating aspect of the situation/context?


4. **Prototype** - inexpensive, scaled down version with the **key features** to investigate the problem and solution. **Goal is to identify the best possible solution**.

- Solutions are investigated, accepted, improved, re-examined, rejected based on user-experiences.
- Should give much better sense sense of constraints and how users would behave, think, and feels when interaction with it.

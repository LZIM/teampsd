# Team PSD 2.0 Participatory Learning and Design _at Scale_ 

## LucidChart and GitHub MVP for Continuous Integration Documentation for Personas

Need to write a detailed guide on what I did and how I did it for other personas.

**Questions**:
Could all the personas use my instructions? Particularly those in qual team or less familiar with maps in general? Do I have templates that are correct or useful? In my experience working with others on LucidChart - they find the platform frustrating and hard to learn.

**Instructions to Personas & Order or Operations**
Make a guide for other user personas - that includes:
1. How they think
2. Why they may use LucidCharts
3. When they might use the maps
4. Where - grants / presentations/etc.

**Personas**
- [ ]  busy_forward_thinking
- [ ]  fast_learner_need_for_transparency
- [ ]  independent_guidance_when_needed
- [ ]  integration_language_expert
- [ ]  detailed_documentation_needed_recent_github_devotee
- [ ]  efficient_value_added_highly_standardized
- [ ]  multistretch_standardize

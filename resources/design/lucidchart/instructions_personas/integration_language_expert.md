Need to write a detailed guide on what I did and how I did it for other personas.
**Questions**:
Could all the personas use my instructions? Particularly those in qual team or less familiar with maps in general? Do I have templates that are correct or useful? In my experience working with others on LucidChart - they find the platform frustrating and hard to learn.
**Instructions to Personas & Order or Operations**
Make a guide for other user personas - that includes:
1. How they think
2. Why they may use LucidCharts
3. When they might use the maps
4. Where - grants / presentations/etc.

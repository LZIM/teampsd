# LucidChart and GitHub MVP for Continuous Integration Documentation for Personas

Need to write a detailed guide on what I did and how I did it for other personas.
**Questions**:
Could all the personas use my instructions? Particularly those in qual team or less familiar with maps in general? Do I have templates that are correct or useful? In my experience working with others on LucidChart - they find the platform frustrating and hard to learn.
**Instructions to Personas & Order or Operations**
Make a guide for other user personas - that includes:
1. How they think
2. Why they may use LucidCharts
3. When they might use the maps
4. Where - grants / presentations/etc.

**Personas**
- [ ]  busy_forward_thinking
- [ ]  fast_learner_need_for_transparency
- [ ]  independent_guidance_when_needed
- [ ]  integration_language_expert
- [ ]  detailed_documentation_needed_recent_github_devotee
- [ ]  efficient_value_added_highly_standardized
- [ ]  multistretch_standardize

## Process 
- The process of linking LucidChart maps and GitHub needs to be made within issues or pull requests - using published links provided by LucidChart 
- Guidance on [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/lucidchart-for-github) and GitHub recommended  the [LucidChart Connector information](https://github.com/marketplace/lucidchart-connector)  



## Instructions for Proposed LucidChart & GitHub Integration for busy_forward_thinking

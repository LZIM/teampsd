## Documentation for Personas
Need to write a detailed guide on what I did and how I did it for other personas.
**Questions**:
Could all the personas use my instructions? Particularly those in qual team or less familiar with maps in general? Do I have templates that are correct or useful? In my experience working with others on LucidChart - they find the platform frustrating and hard to learn.
**Instructions to Personas & Order or Operations**
Make a guide for other user personas - that includes:
1. How they think
2. Why they may use LucidCharts
3. When they might use the maps
4. Where - grants / presentations/etc.

## Process 
- The process of linking LucidChart maps and GitHub needs to be made within issues or pull requests - using published links provided by LucidChart 
- Guidance on [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/lucidchart-for-github) and GitHub recommended  the [LucidChart Connector information](https://github.com/marketplace/lucidchart-connector)  

## Instructions for Proposed LucidChart & GitHub Integration 
- [ ]  Fork TeamPSD Repo
- [ ]  Go to GitHub market place and use GitHub app for integration labelled [LucidChart Connector](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/integrations/github) and follow prompts to install & configure 
- [ ] Within your forked repo create an issue to follow the process of linking LucidChart maps and GitHub within issues or pull requests - using the published links provided by LucidChart 
- [ ] Configuration for this forked repo did work

## Within TeamPSD 
- [ ] Attempted the process of adding the published links provided by LucidChart to an issue on TeamPSD Repo
- [ ] Realize that the configuration did work for this Repo

## Overall Solution for TeamPSD

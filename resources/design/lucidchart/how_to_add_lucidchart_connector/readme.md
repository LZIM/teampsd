## Why LucidChart for Github?
1. Add a flow map to enhance your work in GitHub via an **Issue card** or **Pull Request**
2. Ensure TeamPSD brand consistency in your flowmaps
3. Have flowmaps that update across multiple files

2. [How to Make or Edit LucidChart Flowmaps & Generate Published Links](https://youtu.be/4Ihee2A7seE)

## 1. Install & Configure the LucidChart Connector App
- Follow the **3 step prompts** under "**How to integrate**" [here.](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/integrations/github)
   - **For step 3**, come back here to follow through the steps using TeamPSD's LucidChart account. 
   
## 2. How to use LucidChart Connector on GitHub
**1. Go to TeamPSD's LucidChart account** 
- Use the main TeamPSD account and log in details (In TeamPSD Folder or contact HQ).
- Open a LucidChart document of interest.
   - To learn how to create a map on LucidChart, click here. *(Is there a separate guide or even map on how to make a map on LC? I think it should be separate from this guide which is to focus mainly on the integration and how to use the integration)*

**2. To Generate a Published Link** 
- Click on the **orange Share tab** in the right-hand corner.
- Click on **Advanced**.
- Click on **Publish**. 
- Select **Full document (url)** under the Publish header.
- Click on **Generate Link**.
- Click on the **blue paperclip icon** and **copy** the **highlighted link**.

**3. Go back to GitHub** 
- Copy the link and paste link into a GitHub Issue card or pull request.
- *Link will provide a preview of the map within 1-2 minutes.

**If you have recently made changes to the map, the preview may take a while to update to reflect the changes that were made.*

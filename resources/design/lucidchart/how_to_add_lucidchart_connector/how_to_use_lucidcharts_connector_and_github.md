# Team PSD 2.0 Participatory Learning and Design _at Scale_ LucidChart and GitHub Integration
If you need a flow map to enhance your work in GitHub your options are:

| New Flowmap | Existing Flowmap|
|-------| -----|
| 1. Create a new map using a template [LucidChart](https://app.lucidchart.com/documents#/templates?folder_id=home)| 2. Link an existing flow map into a markdown document [example](https://app.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/5fb53911-fd04-466f-b419-83b34ebb8544/0_0)|

## Integration Functions Within Issues or Pull Requests 
- The process of linking LucidChart maps and GitHub needs to be made within issues or pull requests - using published links provided by LucidChart 
- Guidance on [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/lucidchart-for-github) and GitHub recommended  the [LucidChart Connector information](https://github.com/marketplace/lucidchart-connector)  
- Example within an **issue**

## Integration Process
1. Create forked TeamPDD repo
2. Configure (get GitHub and LucidChart to work together).

## Fork TeamPSd Repo (your version of the TeamPSD Repo)
In order to work asynchronously you will need to fork the TeamPSd repo (creating your own version of the TeamPSD Repo)
- Log in to GitHub
- Select the **fork** sign on the top right hand side
- Label your repo (e.g. debbie_sandbox)
- Ensure that all the setting are in the **Features** include **issues** as the **published links** from **LucidChart** need to be inserted into an **issue** or **pull request**

## Instructions Integration GitHub & LucidChart
- Within your forked repo of [TeamPSD](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd) 
- Go to GitHub market place at the top of the navigation bar and search for [LucidChart Connector](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/integrations/github) and follow prompts to install & configure 
- You will need to give GitHub access to your repo

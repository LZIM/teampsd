## Full Instructions

1. **How to Create a New Issue**
For instructions click [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue)

2. **TeamPSD has 3 types of templates**  

a) [Issues & Features](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue.md)  
This template is the default template when you go to "create a new issue" in Step 1. We use this format only for items that are "issues" (products or functions that already exist but are broken) and "features" (products or functions that do not already exist and need to be scoped out).

Unless you create an issue specifically for the document or manuscript trackers, also assign the issue to "issue_tracker."

b) [Documents](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/issue_templates/document_tracker.md)  
This template is used in the document_tracker to track the steps needed to update documents across each of the 12 sessions of *Modeling to Learn* in the 5 columns of the document_tracker.

If this template needs to be used, go to "Step 1" to create a new issue, delete the template contents in the issue and copy + paste the documents template instead.

c) [Manuscripts](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/master/issue_templates/mansucript_tracker/README.md)  
This template is used when a new card needs to be created for a new manuscript. The naming convention for the card is "abbreviated-grant-name_abbreviated-paper-name_abbreviated-journal-name". For example, "r21_mm_gmb" would mean the paper is related to the R21 grant (r21), focused on the Medication Management module (mm), and will be submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Association (jama). Once the OSF project is created for this manuscript, the link to the project is added in the title as well.

If this template needs to be used, go to "Step 1" to create a new issue, delete the template contents in the issue and copy + paste the manuscript template instead.

## Training Guide: OSF Project (Grant) Registration

### Prior to registering a project:
-	Know what type of registration form do you need? where are you now with your project?
    - https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019738794-Understand-Registration-Forms can also click on the (i) icon during registration process for the same information 
-	Are you waiting for something on your project? Embargo or publicize immediately? 
    -	OSF can leave the registration in embargo for up to 4 years
    -	Embargo keeps a registration private until a specified date. When you enter your registration into an embargo, you can end the embargo early to make your registration public sooner.
    -	Registration can make project immediately public 
        - Pushing the registration to public will not allow any further changes or document uploads besides metadata (Description, Category, Publication, DOI, Affiliated Institutions License, and Tags)
- Registrations cannot be deleted and are irreversible
-	Withdrawing a registration will leave the metadata (title, contributors, DOI, etc) 
-	All submitted registrations will be in a "pending" state until all admins approve the registration (email sent with links) or 48 hours pass (whichever comes first)
-	OSFâ€™s auto-save feature does not always work

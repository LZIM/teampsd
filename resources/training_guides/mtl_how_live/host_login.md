**2. Manage Attendees**
- In the "Attendees" pod in the right hand side, under "Host" you should see "Lindsey Zimmerman" (yourself). If there is more than one person logged in using the team account at the same time, there may be "Lindsey Zimmerman 1", "Lindsey Zimmerman 2", etc. You know which one you are because the text will be *italicized*.  
In this pod, you can also change the status of any attendee by hovering over them to "Make Host" or "Make Presenter" or by click and dragging their name under "Host" or "Presenter".

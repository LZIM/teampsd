## Full Instructions
TeamPSD uses markdown language across multiple workgroups and workflows including GitHub and OSF.
Markdown is a markup language that allows for simple formatting. Below are the formatting needs you will most often encounter:


**YAML Header**
A YAML header is used at the top of every document, meaning we DO NOT use this on issue cards but we DO use this on Learner SEE guides.
- The text coming after each section of the YAML header **must be contained within quotes ("text")** to format properly.
- In the data section, **DO NOT erase the previous person's record of name and date the file was worked on.** Instead, **add** your name and date in while still keeping the record of previous contributors to the document in the YAML header.
- The output section outlines all of the possible ways the document can be outputted. To output the document in one of these other formats, click here.

Look to the very top of this document.


**1. Bold**
To bold a piece of text, use double asterisks (**) before and after the text with no space.

```

**2. Italicize**
To italicize a piece of text, use single asterisks (*) or an underscore (_) before and after the text with no space.

Code View:
```
*You can italicize text like this.*
_Or you can italicize like this._
```

Formatted View:
*You can italicize text like this.*  
_Or you can italicize like this._


**3. Headers**
Headers are created by using hashtags (#) with an increasing number of hashtags used to create smaller and smaller headers. Before the relevant piece of text, add hashtag(s) and a space.

Code View:
```
# This is a Level 1 Header. 
## This is a Level 2 Header.
### This is a Level 3 Header.
#### This is a Level 4 Header.
```

Formatted View:
# This is a Level 1 Header. 
## This is a Level 2 Header.
### This is a Level 3 Header.
#### This is a Level 4 Header.

**4. Numbered Lists**
To create numbered lists, use numbers followed by a period with a carriage return per numbered item.
To create multiple levels, in the list add 3 spaces before the number for each new level.

Code View:
```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   2. Item 3b
      1. Item 3b-1
      2. Item 3b-2
```

Formatted View:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   2. Item 3b
      1. Item 3b-1
      2. Item 3b-2

**4. Bulleted Lists**
To create numbered lists, use dashes followed by a carriage return per bullet item.
To create multiple levels, in the list add 3 spaces before the number for each new level.

Code View:
```
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
   - Item 3a
   - Item 3b
      - Item 3b-1
      - Item 3b-2
```

Formatted View:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
   - Item 3a
   - Item 3b
      - Item 3b-1
      - Item 3b-2
      


#### Common Mistakes:
Double check that you've used the correct number of spaces for the type of formatting you want to do.

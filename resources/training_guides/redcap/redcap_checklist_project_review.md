**Project Review**
1. From your homepage in RedCap in the **Projects Table** select the appropriate project
- [ ] Double check the name of project you are reviewing
- [ ] Edits to projects and instruments can only be made within the project
- [ ] Select the project by clicking on it and enter the project itself.
- [ ] Review the project attributes in Main Project Settings

2. In the section **Design your data collection instruments & enable your surveys** you can edit the content of the project instruments
- [ ] Within the **Online Designer** select the intrument for review
- [ ] Compare the content to the appropriate comparison document (e.g. reflected and match what is in the final grant document).
- [ ] If comparing the instruments to a grant document locate the proper grant documents in the TeamPSD shared drive
- [ ] Look and compare that the measures (within each instrument if approrpiate) from the grant documents are reflected in the corresponding REDCap instrument (i.e R01 measures are in R01 projects and not in IIR projects) 
- [ ] Look for typos and other misc. errors
- [ ] Look for outdated MTL language and update to current language (i.e QI, TAS, etc)

3. **Team PSD Style**
- [ ] Enable the Project and the corresponding instrument(s) as a survey
- [ ] Make sure Team PSD logos, font, colors, are correctly incorporated based on the project

**Tips**
- [ ] Be mindful to save changes at each step - RedCap records changes within each section.
- [ ] Changes made within an instrument are not reflected across all instruments - be mindful to check each instrument

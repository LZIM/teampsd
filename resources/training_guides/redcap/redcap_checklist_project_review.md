## **REDCap Project Review Checklist**

**Getting on REDCAP**
- Provide brief instructions here on how to log in to REDCap or refer to map?

**Project Review**
1. Double check you are looking at the right project 
- [ ] Project name could be slightly different than what it should reflect -> update the project name if needed
- [ ] Some projects may not exist, but the measures can be copied over from another previous project (i.e R01 MTL Blue Baseline project can be used to create a R01 MTL Red Baseline project)
- [ ] Place holder for instructions to copying a project here; should we refer them to the training guide if they forget or do not know how?]

2. Project instruments: This is where measures are located. These should be reflected and match what is in the final grant document.
- [ ] Locate the proper grant documents in the TeamPSD shared drive
- [ ] Look and compare that the measures from the grant documents are reflected in the corresponding REDCap project (i.e R01 measures are in R01 projects and not in IIR projects) 
- [ ] Look for typos and other misc. errors
- [ ] Look for outdated MTL language and update to current language (i.e QI, TAS, etc)

3. Team PSD Style
- [ ] Enable the Project and the corresponding instrument(s) as a survey
- [ ] Make sure Team PSD logos, font, colors, are correctly incorporated based on the project

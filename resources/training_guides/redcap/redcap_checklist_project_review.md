- [ ] Within the **Online Designer** select the instrument for review to edit the compoments of the instrument itself.
- [ ] Compare instrument you are reviewing to the appropriate original document.
- [ ] Open the **Instrument** and review each of the questions or variable options in it.
- [ ] Be sure to check the options and **branching logic** within each varible.
- [ ] If comparing the instruments to a grant document, locate the proper grant documents in the TeamPSD shared drive.

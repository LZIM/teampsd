### Splash Page Update
This update should be done on a monthly basis in order to populate the splash pages with the most recent data. This process includes four key steps--database table updates, updating the SplashMothership, running the data propagation, and validating the results.

#### 1. Database Table Updates

#### 2. Updating the SplashMothership

#### 3. Run the Data Propagation

#### 4. Validate Results


### Sharepoint Updates
Note: To make any changes to the Sharepoint site you need to have admin privileges--if you need priviliges please contact Stacey or Anthony before attempting to make any edits.

The Sharepoint page at mtl.how enables a lot of flexibility in terms of the look and feel we can create. This guide will quickly walk you through the various setting menus and editing tools available to us.

### Sharepoint Updates
Note: To make any changes to the Sharepoint site you need to have admin privileges--if you need priviliges please contact Stacey or Anthony before attempting to make any edits.

The Sharepoint page at mtl.how enables a lot of flexibility in terms of the look and feel we can create. This guide will quickly walk you through the various setting menus and editing tools available to us.

#### 1. Site Contents
To view all the folders and files that exist in our sharepoint click the gear in the top right and select "Site Contents".

-Insert Site Contents SS- 

#### 2. Page and Document Edits

We can edit individual pages and documents to make changes to their content. This is done by clicking the edit button in the top right corner of any page.
-Insert Edit SS-
When you edit a page you will need to check it out--this is similar to creating a branch on github, it creates a local copy for you to make changes to without impacting others.
-Insert Checkout SS-
Now by selecting different elements on the screen you can make changes to them similar to Word or if you click insert you can add new content.

-Insert SS of Toolbar-
For WebParts (like the Excel charts) you may need to go into the WebPart properties to make certain changes.
-Insert SS of Web Part Properties-
Once you have made your changes you need to check in the file, at this point you should assign a reviewer to go over your changes and publish them. Think of this as making a pull request.
-Insert SS of Check In-

Note: Sharepoint has 50 mb limit for worksheets, if a site has a data set that is too large we need to allow their data to be opened in excel via the pop up. This is enabled in the WebApp properties shown above.
#### 3. Site Settings and Usage Data
In the Site Settings you can change things like what our Welcome Page is or who has permissions to access our site. This window can be found by selecting the settings gear in the top right and selecting "Site Settings".

-Insert Site Settings SS-

Note: To view the Usage Statistics of our page go to Site Settings and click the "Popularity Trends" link under Site Administration.

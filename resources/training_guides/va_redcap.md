Introduction


Baseline & 6 month measures for R01 & IIR grants. This is the only RESEARCH portion of our grants. Everything else we do goes under "Operations".
 

RedCap is a free survey platform created by Vanderbilt. Today, we will watch training videos to orient us to the platform.

As we are watching these videos, let's try to each create a fake project to click around and explore.

## Training Objectives:
By the end of this training, learners will be able to:
1. Create a new project with appropriate titles, purpose, and template
2. Understand the different types of user roles and their privileges
3. Create REDCap accounts for new users
4. Use survey queue for creating a logic where all users can use a single link but still getpa to their individual survey

### General Overview
1. What is REDCap?
REDCap or Research Electronic Data Capture, is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases. REDCap was originally created by a small team at Vanderbilt, and has since expanded across thousands of non-profit and government organizations. Each system is independently maintained and supported - we specifically are using the VA REDCap. You can check out FAQ's, videos, etc. at the main REDCap website [here](https://www.project-redcap.org/).

2. When does TeamPSD use REDCAP? 
- We use it in the _Modeling to Learn_ program at Session 4 for the _Modeling to Learn_ Menu (mtl.how/menu) that assesses team needs and priorities to pick an _MTL_ module to use starting Session 5
- Research surveys from measures in the grants that are taken at baseline and 6 months. Remember, these surveys are **voluntary and can be stopped at any time**.

#### Learning Check:
1. What are TeamPSD's varying uses of REDCap? How do they align against timelines with the _Modeling to Learn_ 12 session plan? 
2. What audience is each use geared towards?

### Overview of REDCap
This [overview video of REDCap - Video](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/consortium/videoplayer.php?video=redcap_overview03.mp4&title=Detailed+Overview+of+REDCap+%2814+min%29&text=This+14-minute+video+provides+a+thorough+overview+of+REDCap+and+much+of+its+functionality.+%0A%09%09%09%09%09%09%09%09%09This+video+is+an+excellent+place+to+begin+learning+about+REDCap+and+what+it+is+capable+of.&referer=REDCAP_PUBLIC) video includes how to create new projects in REDCap and how to edit records.

#### Learning Check:
1. In what situation would an HQ member enter data in a record *instead* of the learner?
2. A learner has a question about their survey data, where do you go to check or edit their record?

### How to Create and Work with Instruments
This [introduction to instrument development](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/consortium/videoplayer.php?video=intro_instrument_dev.mp4&title=Introduction+to+Instrument+Development+%286+min%29&text=&referer=REDCAP_PUBLIC) and [online instrument designer view](https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/consortium/videoplayer.php?video=online_designer01.flv&title=The+Online+Designer+%285+min%29&text=&referer=REDCAP_PUBLIC) details how to use "instruments" in REDCap.

#### Learning Check:
1. What are the differences between settings at the "project" level and the "instrument" level"?

### Managing Design, Auotmation, and Participant Management
Follow [this PDF](https://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/crc/workshop_files/2014-09-19.pdf) through for a walkthrough of different customization options for designing and queuing instruments, managing invitations and participants. 

#### Learning Check:
1. Let's review the vocab we learned today specific to REDCap and how it maps to our _Modeling to Learn_ or TeamPSD language:
- Users
- Projects
- Instruments
- Participants
- Queue
- Records
- Invitations

#### Common Mistakes:

1. If you're clicking through any of the surveys to test them, make sure to delete your records afterwards so it does not affect our data reports and analysis. 

2. Are you or someone unable to see specific menu options that they typically expect to see? Check the user roles.

 1. Draft a section for the Team PSD Manual that includes the Team PSD weekly tour of duty.

The Team PSD weekly schedules are in the Team PSD > teampsd_schedule > "teampsd_weekly_schedule_2020_02_20.docx"

They were last updated in February 2020, and could be updated again to reflect our team_temp check-ins, which started due to COVID-19, and Rita's adjusted 30/10 tour.

 2. Draft a section for the Team PSD Manual that describes the email pre-approval policy, and ADP entry for adjustments to tour.

We will secure signatures for this policy during our upcoming 1:1s.

Thanks!

# MS Teams
TeamPSD and the VA are both using [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app) as their main communication platform.

TeamPSD is using the **Free Version of Microsoft Teams** so the entire team can get used to it as the VA begins to roll it out system-wide by early August.  

## Quick Start Guide
To review the basics of Microsoft Teams, check out their [Quick Start Guide](https://www.chorus.co/media/2989/quickstart-guide-to-teams-chorus.pdf).
This guide will help you learn the basic user interface functions of Microsoft Teams (**Free version or VA**) such as: 
- Signing In
- Manage your profile settings
- Choose/browse channels
- Start a meeting or call
- Start a new conversation thread
- Reply within a message/conversation thread
- @ Mention someone
- Start a 1:1 or small group chat
- Add/Share/Work with Files
- and more!

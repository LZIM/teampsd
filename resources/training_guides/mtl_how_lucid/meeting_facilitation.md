# Team PSD Guide to Meeting Facilitation


## Meeting Facilitation and Management on Lucid
Steps needed for effective meeting faciliation and management
### 1. Edit agenda
### 2. Add documents
### 3. Send meeting reminder in advance and remind to RSVP
### 4. Take notes on decisions, action items, and issues using buttons
### 5. Publish to basecamp
### 6. Send followup email



### Starting a Lucid Meeting
- [ ] 1. If you are starting/ending the meeting, always login using Lindsey's account.
- [ ] 2. Hit "Record" on the audio.

### During a Lucid Meeting
- [ ] 1. If it can tracked in a GitHub issue, include all Decisions and Action Items in the relevant GitHub issue.

### Otherwise...
- [ ] 1. Track final decisions using the "Decisions" tag. It is not useful to track intermittent suggestions instead of the final decision as this is our record for folks who missed the meeting and for us to refer back to later
- [ ] 2. Use the "Issues" tag to note any issues brought up that we need to revisit later.
- [ ] 2. Use the "Action Item

### Ending a Lucid Meeting

- [ ] 1. Before you end the meeting, double-check that no one else is still writing any notes.
End the meeting.
- [ ] 2. Re-read the meeting record and clean up notes. Make sure all notes are clear with headers and reflect final decisions and next steps indicating the "Who" "What" and "When". Tag any "Decisions" or "Issues" using their respective tags. If any of the decisions relate to open GitHub issues, update the GitHub thread as well.
- [ ] 3. Click "Publish" to Basecamp once you end the meeting.
- [ ] 4. Click send out "Follow-Up" email. **Note**: If there is an accompanying mtl.how/live recording - 1) Backup the recording (instructions here), 2) Email the Lucid follow-up to only yourself, 3) Forward the Lucid follow-up using regular email to all attendees including the link to the backed-up recording to meeting attendees.

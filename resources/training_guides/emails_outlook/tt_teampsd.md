## TeamPSD TeamTime Report Checklist


### Create a new tt_report document:
 - [ ] Within the TeamPSD internal folder, navigate to the folder tt_teampsd and open it.
 - [ ] Copy the last tt_report_## folder.
 - [ ] Update the report number to the next number in the sequence for both the folder and the word doc inside it.
 - [ ] Open the word doc.
 
 ### Within the Word Doc, in order from top to bottom:
 - [ ] Update the report number under the team time logo.
 - [ ] Place weekly announcements at the top  of the report - any updates relevant across the team with screenshots and links if necessary.
 - [ ] Add ZenHub reports by taking screen-shots of Burndown Report and Control Chart and replacing prior ones
  - Go to teampsd's ZenHub workspace mtl.how/zenhub and get a run a generate a Burndown Report of the closed issues since the start of the current epic and a Control Chart - select the previous week and number of closed issues

 - [ ] For mtl.how/lucid, take a screenshot of the next two weeks from Lindsey's team Lucid calendar. Make sure to ping all Workgroup Leads regarding updates and changes prior to taking this screenshot. Replace the existing screenshot with the new one.
 - [ ] For mtl.how/bugs, mtl.how/features, mtl.how/manuscripts, and mtl.how/documentation, go to each of these shortlinks and screenshot the trackers. Replace the existing screenshots with the new ones. 
   - Make sure the text for each of the short links is hyperlinked to the matching link. To hyperlink:
     - Right-click on relevant text
     - Click on "Link"
     - Paste the link into "Address"
     - Click on "Ok"
   - Make sure the screenshots for each of the trackers are hyperlinked to their matching trackers as well.
   - Screenshots should be large enough that the text is readable and meaningful.
 
### Copy to Outlook:
- [ ] Ctrl + A to select everything in the document
- [ ] Ctrl + C to copy
- [ ] Open a new Outlook email and in the body, Ctrl + V to paste your tt report
- [ ] Double check:
  - All fonts are in Myriad Pro
  - All colors are consistent with TeamPSD style which can be found [here](https://github.com/lzim/teampsd/blob/teampsd_style/colors.md). 
    - We use VA Light Blue for linked text, icons, and the announcements text box. We use VA Light Red for the arrows that separate each section.
  - All items are aligned and not covering each other, or off the page.
  
### Setup Recipients & Subject Line:
- [ ] In the "To" line of the email, include two groups:
  - TeamPSD VA emails listserv (if you need this address, ask an HQ member)
  - TeamPSD non-VA emails (if you need these set of addresses, ask an HQ member)
    - Several of our team members are not primarily VA staff, and will need the reports sent to their non-VA emails to make sure they get them.
- [ ] In the "Subject Line," start with "[tt###_teampsd]" followed by a one-line summary of the important updates.
  - "###" = the three digit report number
  - Including this header in the subject line helps people find the report later, and distinguishes this TeamTime report as the internal TeamPSD newsletter version instead of the version for the _Modeling to Learn_ teams.
  
### Send Report
- [ ] Send report by:
  - Using scheduled delivery
    - Click on the "Options" tab at the top
    - Click on "Delay Delivery"
    - In the pop-up window, check "Do Not Deliver Before" and set the date to Monday morning of the next week at 5am Pacific (which is 8am Eastern or start of tour for our East Coast partners!)
    - Click "Close"
    - Click "Send"
  - Sometime the scheduled delivery can be buggy. You can also just keep the email as a draft over the weekend and click "Send" firt thing Monday AM at 7:30am Pacific.

### Tips:
- Copy & paste from Outlook to Word by changing your image "Wrap" settings. For all images and text boxes:
  - Right click on the item
  - Click on "In Front of Text"
  - Click on "Move with Text"
- For the TeamPSD non-VA emails, it's easiest to create a  contact group of all the emails to keep track of them in one place:
  - Open Outlook
  - Click on the "People" icon on the bottom left of the screen after the "Mail" and "Calendar" icons.
  - In "Name," add a name for your contact group i.e. teampsd_non_va. This is what you will search for later when you add the entire group as recipients to an email.
  - Click on "New Contact Group" > "Add Members"
  - Add the non-VA email addresses and click "Save & Close"

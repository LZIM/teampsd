Addtional Appt Supply for New CC Patients,,Add Appointments for New Patients [Appt/Week],"The number of additional appointments offered each week to new patients, with the assumption that the team currently has no such carve-outs. Any increase in supply for new patients comes from reducing appointments offered in other services.", ,,3 Add Appointments for New Patients , ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
User-defined Appointment Supply,Appointment Supply,Appointment Supply [Appt/Week],"The number of official appointments offered each week.

Overbook Appointments / Week,Overbooks,Overbooks [Appt/Week],"The number of additional appointments offered each week (over the official appointment supply) with the assumption that these additional appointments come at the expense of non-patient facing care (e.g., team coordination, reminder calls, treatment planning, etc.).", , ,4 Overbooks, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Desired RVI,Return Visit Interval,Return Visit Interval [Appt/Week],"The desired return visit interval, regardless of whether or not the team has enough supply for the patient demand or the effect on new patient starts. This value replaces the base case value, which is estimated from the team's data..",Return Visit Interval (Week),Return Visit Interval (Week),5 Return Visit Interval, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
User-defined True Missed Appointments,True Missed Appointments %,True Missed Appointments %,"The proportion of total appointments that are missed and rescheduled (i.e., rework).

Sensitivity of Changes in Other CC Tasks Time on Missed Appointments,Effect of Task Time on Missed Appointments,Effect of Task Time on Missed Appointments [Sensitivity],"The effect size of changes in relative time available for other Care Coordination tasks on the likilihood of patients or providers missing an appointment. A value of ""zero"" implies that there is no relationship between overbooks and missed appointments. A value below 1 indicates that patients are not sensitive to small changes in other CC task time; an exponent greater than 1 indicates that patients are very sensitive to small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20% more hours per week than their official supply, then an exponent of ""1"" would indicate that the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20% higher than the base case. A value of 0.5 would cause that same 20% increase in hours worked would only cause a 9.5% increase in the missed appointment ratio.  A value of 2 would cause that 20% increase to increase the missed appointment rate by 44% over the base case.", , ,9 Effect of Task Time on Missed Appointments, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Use Team Data on Patients Starts,Use Team Data for Starting Rate ON/OFF,Use Team Data for Starting Rate,"Switch controling if the number of new patient starts per week is based on either a) the remaining appointment supply after all existing patients are seen, or b) the average new patient start rate estimated from the team's data, which can be helpful in assessing the supply and RVI needed to meet the team's real-world demand. The default is set to ignore the team's average patient start rate, and instead continually match patient starts to available appointment capacity.  ""Off"" = if all existing patients can be seen at the desired RVI, then only start new patients in the remaining appointment slots. ""On"" = start new patients based on the team's average rate, even if there won't be enough supply to see existing patients at the desired RVI. ", , ,1 Use Team Data for Starting Rate, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Desired New Patient Wait Time,Target Wait Time,Target Wait Time [Week],"The team's goal for average new patient wait time.  This value replaces the base case value, which is estimated from the team's data.", , ,7 Target Wait Time, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sensitivity of Referrals to Wait Time,Effect of Wait Time on Referrals,Effect of Wait Time on Referrals [Sensitivity],"The effect size of changes in new patient wait time on service attractiveness and referrals, where referrals drop as wait time increases. A value of ""1"" implies the assumption that a doubling of the new patient wait time (relative to the new patient wait time goal) will cut the referral rate in half.  For the same situation, a value of ""0.5"" would reduce the referral rate to 71% of its original value, and a value of ""1.5"" would reduce the referral rate to 35%.", , ,10 Effect of Wait Time on Referrals, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,

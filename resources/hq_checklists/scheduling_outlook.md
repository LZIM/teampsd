## Scheduling Outlook Invitation

- [ ] 1. On your own calendar, click on New Meeting in the top left.
- [ ] 2. **To**: add all meeting attendees by email including Lindsey.  
**Note**: If Lindsey is traveling, her gmail may need to be included.
- [ ] 3. **Subject**: Create a title descriptive enough for anyone to know what the meeting is about. Include the first & last name of main attendees involved & relevant context of the meeting (i.e. "Connect w/Jane Doe for TeamPSD Mentorship).
- [ ] 4. **Location**: Audio: 1-800-767-1750, 27379; Screenshare: mtl.how/live
- [ ] 5. **Time**: Double check that everyone is available in the time window specified.  
**Note**: Double check that Lindsey is not walking/driving to a another meeting before/after the one you are scheduling. If so, she needs buffer time.
- [ ] 6. **Body**: Give context of meeting & re-write meeting details included in the "Location" section earlier. Include timezones (i.e. PST) when specifying times as many partners are not in the same time zone.
- [ ] 7. Make sure to call the VANTS scheduling line (304-262-7600) to schedule the call you just made.

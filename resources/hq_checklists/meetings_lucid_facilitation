## Meeting Facilitation on Lucid

### Starting a Lucid Meeting
- [ ] Open **LucidMeetings** on a web browser **Login** using **Lindsey's account**.
- [ ] On the calendar **Select** and **Join** the appropriate meeting.
- [ ] Be sure to **Ask attendees** if they are OK to record meeting.
- [ ] The **Record** button is located on the top right hand corner of the screen.


### During a Lucid Meeting - Notes
- [ ] Take contemporary notes during the meeting directly on **Lucid Agenda**.
- [ ] If issues being discussed can tracked on **GitHub** make notes directly on the issue.
- [ ] Include all **Decisions** and **Action Items** for each issue discussed on **GitHub** and **LucidMeeting**. 
- [ ] Track the final decisions using the **Decisions** tag on LucidMeeting. 
- [ } It is not useful to track all intermittent suggestions/discussion - focus on the final decision(s)
- [ ] LucidMeeting is our record for folks who missed the meeting and for us to refer back to later.
- [ ] Use the **Issues** tag to note any issues brought up that we need to revisit later.
- [ ] Use the **Action Item** if needed and assign a person responsible an estimate due date.
- [ ] Keep individual notes **brief** as others cannot see notes until the individual note is saved.
- [ ] Be sure to **Not Edit** others notes without permission.
- [ ] Making **Live Edits** on another person's notes, prevents their content from being saved.

### Ending a Lucid Meeting

- [ ] Before you end the meeting, **double-check** that no one else is **still writing any notes** or their content will be lost.
- [ ] Ensure that you **re-read** the meeting record and **clean up notes**. 
- [ ] Make sure all notes are clear with headers and reflect final decisions and next steps.
- [ ] When the meeting has come to a close, and has also occured on **AdobeConnect** be sure to copy the **Notes in the Chat** of AdobeConenct to the **Chat Section** of Lucidmeeting.
- [ ] End the meeting by selecting **End Meeting** on the bottom left of the LucidMeeting screen.

### Sending Lucid Meeting - Follow-up Email
- [ ] If the meeting occured **only** on **LucidMeeting** and did not include AdobeConnect, send a **Follow-Up** email.
- [ ] Select send a **Follow-Up** email at the top of the LucidMeeting screen.
- [ ] In the **Follow-Up Message** box include a message to **Thank meeting attendees and any other relevant information**
- [ ] Select **all** for the **Follow-Up Recipients** option.

**Note**: If there is an accompanying **mtl.how/live** from **AdobeConnect** recording **don't see the follow-up email**. Check **AdobeConnect** checklist first.

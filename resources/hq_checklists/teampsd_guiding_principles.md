# Team PSD Guiding Principles		
		
### 1. Effective Communication 		
Assume everyone youâ€™re communicating with is smarter than you and cares more than you and is busier than you. Whether it's in emails, meeting agendas, or GitHub issues, always include the full context and details necessary to make an informed decision (and make sure you are up to speed on the context and details before responding). Use emojis or humor (as appropriate) to help maintain a positive and collegial vibe.

### 2. Transparent & Reproducible Workflow

- Use email for private discussions.

		exponent greater than 1 indicates that patients are very sensitive to \
		small changes. Example: if a team is putting in 20% more hours per week \

		the ratio of missed appointments to all appointments would also be 20% \
		higher than the base case. A value of 0.5 would cause that same 20% \

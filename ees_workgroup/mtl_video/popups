07 CC | Correction? | LZ | We’re looking at the results and struggling to explain the   oscillation (though small empirically). We do not mention the observed   immediate jump from 32 to 34 in starting rate. We kept Use Team Data on, and   the number in the table is 32. Might help to explain why the output chart   shows 34? And that this explains the oscillation? | ~25:xx
07 CC | Correction? | LZ | When LZ says we can use the shortcut we “showed in Session 7”   about pulling up a prior run. Don’t think we’ve introduced that – but   probably small and should just leave it alone. | Done/Do
07 CC | Correction? | LZ | Also in this demo, the run pulled up to show BC is a sim that   hasn’t been run - as we can see when she goes to save it – which is why the   results dashboard shows empty graphs. This deserves a comment. I suggest a   correction popup, LZ: “You will see your 2-year results if you pull the right   BC – the one you actually ran.” Could even have a little picture of a results   dashboard with BC charts like you should see. | Done/Do

1.	**Which of these is one purpose of *Modeling to Learn*?**
-	help VA clinic staff understand which treatment decisions are in their control
-	understand clinic services available to veterans
-	provide templates for Evidence-based Psychotherapies (EBPs)
-	Document progress on SAIL measures
	
2.	**Which of these is a *Modeling to Learn* Module?**
-	Psychotherapy (PSY)
-	Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
-	Clinic Data Management
-	Mental Health Management
	
3.	***Modeling to Learn* uses a specific format for accessing the various web pages associated with the project. It is:**
-	mtl.how/_________
-	ModelingToLearn.com/ ______________
-	VA_Modeling.com/ ______________
-	VAModels.net/ ______________
	
4.	**The purpose of *Modeling to Learn* Module 4 was to:**
-	Prioritize the clinic team’s learning needs as result of individual team member input
-	Learn how to generate care quality data for VA administrators
-	Identify strategies to adjust VA patient care schedules
-	Document individual professional development needs
	
5.	**Two of the team learning need categories in mtl.how/menu included:**
-	Schedule and Mix of Services
-	Staffing Hours and Performance Management
-	Care Coordination and Clinician Stress
-	Quality Indicators and Utilization Measures
		
6.	**In identifying a topic for future team learning and action, the team should consider the mtl.how/menu results relative to:**
-	Learning needs with the strongest agreement across all team member responses
-	Learning needs with widely varied rankings
-	Learning needs mandated by the VA administration
-	Learning needs by specific clinician type.
		
7.	**Staffing and burnout were the two highest priority areas identified by a VA clinic team. The team should most likely:**
-	Revisit their team vision and team data to discuss patient management and staffing strategies to reduce overwork
-	Hire more staff
-	Review exit interviews with former staff to identify retention strategies
-	None of the above 
	
8.	**A team’s vision was “Increasing Use of EBP Templates” and its highest priority need was adoption of evidence-based psychotherapies. Which MTL module do you think that team should use going forward?**
-	Psychotherapy (PSY)
-	Care Coordination (CC)
-	Medication Management (MM)
-	Aggregrate team services (AGG)
-	Measurement-based stepped care for suicide prevention 
	
9.	**Based on your team’s vision and the highest priority need selected by your team, which MTL simulation module do you think your team should use?**
-	Care Coordination (CC)
-	Medication Management (MM)
-	Psychotherapy (PSY)
-	Aggregrate team services (AGG)
	
10.	**To date, the *Modeling to Learn* steps I have completed are:**
-	Review team data and complete the mtl.how/menu to prioritize team learning needs
-	Review team data and create a team name
-	Identify team learning needs and determine clinic practice change strategies
-	Become familiar with the user interfaces for data and model simulation

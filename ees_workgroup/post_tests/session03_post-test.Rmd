1.	**Which of these is one purpose of *Modeling to Learn*?**	
-	use team data to guide implementation of timely, evidence-based psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies (EBPs)	
-	understand clinic services available to veterans	
-	Document progress on SAIL measures	
-	show VA clinic staff decisions that are not in their control	
		
2.	**Which of these is a *Modeling to Learn* Module?**	
-	Psychotherapy (PSY)	
-	Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)	
-	Clinic Data Management	
-	Mental Health Management	
		
3.	***Modeling to Learn* uses data that reflects:**	
-	A VA clinic team’s data	
-	VA data associated with SAIL measures	
-	VA general patient data	
-	VA primary care data	
		
4.	**The data in mtl.how/data is presented:**	
-	Using means, medians and percentages	
-	By team trends	
-	In a format that allows a team to generate a team data table for use in the simulation model	
-	All of the above	
		
5.	**In the context of *Modeling to Learn*, the acronym “UI” means:**	
-	User interface	
-	Upon interaction	
-	Under the influence	
-	Up in the air	
			
6.	**When the learner generates a team data table for use in the model simulation user interface (UI):**	
-	Data is produced for each module in *Modeling to Learn* (CC, MM, PSY, AGG, Suicide Prevention)	
-	The data file will never have to be generated again.	
-	Any VA user can access the data.	
-	Only certain data items can be downloaded.		
		
7.	**The Parameters tabs in the data UI, contain:**	
-	Data variables specific to each *MTL* module	
-	Patient-specific Data	
-	Clinician-specific Data	
-	All data from that VISN	
		
8.	**New Patient Wait Time and Return to Clinic Visit Interval are examples of:**	
-	Variables that may be controlled by a clinic team	
-	*Modeling to Learn* modules	
-	Measures specific to only VA mental health clinics	
-	Terms used by VA patients when scheduling appointments	
				
9.	**When reviewing the team data, it is most helpful for a clinic team to consider:**	
-	The trends in team care over time	
-	The units for the individual patient measures	
-	The differences between last year and this year	
-	The specific clinician diagnoses codes	
				
10.	**By making team data available to clinicians as part of *Modeling to Learn*, it is hoped that:**	
-	Completion of EBPs templates may be enhanced	
-	Clinicians will feel in control of certain aspects of clinic processes	
-	Team-based care coordination may be more efficient and effective	
-	All of the above

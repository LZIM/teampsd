## Branches
TeamPSD uses branches to collaborate on work without impacting our production environment otherwise known as the master branch.

For details on what branches are and how they are used please read the GitHub documentation here: [About Branches](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-branches).


### master :
The master branch contains the production ready content on the repository and is always stable and ready for use.

Contributions are added to the master branch after moving through the [feature](#feature) and [qa](#qa) branches; following the TeamPSD development cycle outlined [here](link-to-teampsd-manual-dev-test-prod-cycle).


### gh-pages:
The gh-pages branch contains the markdown files that are being compiled in the TeamPSD Manual available at [mtl.how/Manual](mtl.how/manual). Treated as a production branch like master moving through the same [feature](#feature) and [qa](#qa) development cycle.

These files are treated as chapters in the manual and are kept separate from the other files in the Team PSD repository.


### feature:
The feature branches are used for developing new content or making changes to existing materials.

Instead of committing directly to the master branch, team members create a new branch every time they start work on a new feature. Feature branches should have names that describe the contribution being made.

Feature branches enable team contributions to the project without disruption to the master branch.

For details on creating a feature branch and moving through the development cycle are outlined [here](link-to-teampsd-manual-dev-test-prod-cycle).

### qa:
Before a feature can be merged into master it must go through review in the qa branch. This branch is used for testing contributions to make sure they integrate and meet the Team PSD standards.

The details and requirements for moving into and through the qa branch are outlined [here](link-to-teampsd-manual-dev-test-prod-cycle).

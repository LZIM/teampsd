## Active listening is a stance. 
Taking the stance that misunderstanding is the norm and using skills appropriate to that reality.

### 1. General skills: Reflecting content for efficiency and interpersonal rapport (i.e., avoiding rework and frustration)
- "when in doubt, check it out" - listener's job to help the speaker understand what they are getting or what they missed.
- let the speaker know when you're falling behind, stop them before the conversation exceeds your understanding.
- Use the same precise language/vocabulary.

### 2. Chunking components of what some said (e.g., looking for the "and")
- Listening for the main points
- This is a key skill to keep up with complex ideas in the moment (You don't want to get bogged down on point one and miss point 2).

### 3. Reflection of feeling - listen for the feeling words and reflect them exactly. 
- Don't reflect "frustration" when someone is expressing "disappointment" or "stress."
- Use the exact feeling word you heard is the safest way to ensure the person feels heard.
- You can use these for non-verbals too.
- If you hear a feeling, it's better to address it in your reflection.

### 4. Synthesizing two person's ideas; or just two ideas (or more)
- e.g. "on the one hand, I hear Anthony saying..." and "on the other hand, I hear Stacey saying..."
- Synthesis brings the ideas together. Not just active listening both ideas as separate ideas.

### 5. Summarizing active listening - used when it's time to wrap up and move on and a lot of ideas have been said.
- this is not the time to bring new points.
- end with a summary of the key points of consensus and the key take aways of what to do next.

### 6. Add to what the person is saying. (improv "yes, and..." - don't reject ideas, just try to understand and the build on the ideas).
- forward momentum comes from making sure you understand the person, but also add your own contribution.
- listening is about being present to understand; you don't have to agree with what a person is saying.
- KEY IDEA: really attend to make sure you understand, do NOT think about your response when you should be listening.
- Before you even get to agreement/disagreement, make sure you have understanding first.

### Things to look out for - 
#### If you know yourself:
You are the only one who knows whether it's time to multi-task, focus, scribe as a form of listening, or whether typing would be a distraction.
#### Repetition cycle: 
Your first move should be to assume that you're missing something.
#### Your own feelings:
If you're starting to feel frustrated, it's a key sign that you should use active listening.
